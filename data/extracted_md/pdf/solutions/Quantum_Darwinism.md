pointer states are at the top. This criterion – the pre-
dictability sieve [4, 8, 9] – yields a short list of candidates
for effectively classical states: A cat can persist in one
of the two obvious stable states, but their superposition
would deteriorate into a mixture of |deadi and |alivei
when initiated in a way envisaged by Schrödinger [2].
   The special role of position is traced to the nature of
the SE interactions: They tend to depend on distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

state of the system is however altered by the swap, illustrating subjective nature of Laplace’s approach, and demonstrating its
unsuitability for physics. (c) Perfectly known entangled states have objective symmetries that allow one to rigorously deduce
probabilities. When two systems are maximally entangled as above, probabilities of Schmidt partners are equal, p♥ = p♦ , and
p♠ = p♣ . After a swap uS = |♠ih♥| + |♥ih♠| in S, the resulting state |♠i|♦i + |♥i|♣i must have p0♠ = p♦ , and p0♥ = p♣ . (We
‘primed’ probabilities in S, as it was acted upon by a swap, so they might have changed.) A counterswap uE = |♦ih♣| + |♣ih♦|
in E restores the original entangled state, proving that p0♥ = p♥ and p0♠ = p♠ , after all (as counterswap uE leaves S untouched).
This sequence of equalities implies p♠ = p♦ = p♥ , so that p♠ = p♥ = 12 , as probabilities in S must add up to 1.
