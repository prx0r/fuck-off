If there are fewer significant issues in the requested area than the maximum ({max_items}), produce only as many items as are genuinely warranted.
""" if focus_area else ""}

### Principles guiding your review (ordered by importance)
1. Your review must be factually correct:
   Your claims will be checked by domain experts. Any incorrect or unsupported criticism will undermine the credibility of your review. When uncertain, avoid speculation.
2. Your review must consist of only significant issues:
   Only point out problems that meaningfully affect the paper based on the evaluation criteria ({criteria_names_summary}). Do not focus on minor or cosmetic issues. You don't always have to fill all {max_items} issues in case there isn't anything to point out. However, it is equally bad if there are clearly significant problems in the paper but you don't point them out.
3. Your review must be concise and only criticize at most {max_items} major aspects with detailed evidence:
   Each criticism must be supported with detailed evidence. Specifically, mention the contextual background of what the authors attempted to do, and why that was not sufficient when comparing to common practices in the field (e.g., refer to how other relevant papers attempted to address this issue and why it is more precise or comprehensive compared to this paper).


### Rules for constructing each item
1. Each item consists of exactly two components: a claim and evidence.
2. The claim is the criticism itself. In the claim, you must clearly state:
   a. What you are criticizing the paper for.
   b. On which evaluation criterion or criteria the criticism is based (the list of evaluation criteria is provided below).
   c. Which component of the paper the criticism refers to (e.g., a specific argument, experiment, dataset, or methodological claim). The claim must not contain any quoted sentences or code blocks. All quoted material must appear only in the evidence section.
3. The evidence must directly support the claim and show why it identifies a major issue.
   You should quote the following:
   a. Exact sentences from the main paper or supplementary materials.
   b. Exact code blocks or functions from the paper's code.
   c. Exact sentences from papers in the literature (these must be hyperlinked and cited).
   IMPORTANT: Every single Quote MUST be immediately followed by its own Comment. Never write two consecutive Quotes without a Comment in between. If multiple quotes support the same point, each quote still needs its own individual comment explaining its relevance.
4. At the end of the review, include a citation list containing all literature references used in your evidence.
   Each reference must be numbered using [1], [2], [3], and every in-text citation must be written as [[N]](#refN) (e.g., [[1]](#ref1), [[2]](#ref2)) so that it becomes a clickable hyperlink.
   If you do not have the ability to search external literature, write "N/A (no literature search tools available)" in place of the search query.
5. The review must not include an introduction, summary, or concluding remarks.
   It must contain at most {max_items} items, and a citation list at the end.
6. All output must be valid markdown.
7. You must separate each item with a blank line.
{limitations_instruction}
9. The items should be sorted by their importance. This means that the first item is the most important one, and the last item is the least important one. The importance is decided by the priority of the evaluation criteria (explained below).
10. Never output raw triple-backticks inside quotation marks. If evidence is a code block, place the fenced code block outside of quotation marks.
11. Use the format Item 1, Item 2, ..., with no fraction or denominator.
12. Each item must include exactly one Concrete Action Item section after the Evidence section. The action item should be long and detailed enough to be directly actionable. Choose "Fix the writing" if the issue can be resolved by modifying or adding text in the paper. Choose "Add new implementation" if the issue requires adding code, running new experiments, or producing new results. For "Add new implementation", also create the actual code files in the verification_code directory.


### Required structure and format of each item
1. Each item should be written formally (e.g., "This paper makes an inaccurate claim that..." instead of "I am criticizing the paper for...").
2. Each item must be totally self-contained.
3. Each item must be independent of other items.
4. Each item must be formatted exactly as follows:
```
## Item {{n}}: <short title summarizing the criticism>

#### Claim
* Main point of criticism: <State what you are criticizing the paper for>
* Evaluation criteria: <which evaluation criteria the criticism is based on>
{limitations_status_line}

#### Evidence
* Quote: <Exact sentence(s) 1 from the paper>
   * Comment: <Explanation of why this sentence is incorrect or problematic>
* Quote: <Exact sentence(s) 2 from the paper>
   * Comment: <Explanation of why this sentence is incorrect or problematic>
* Quote: <Exact code block 1, rendered as a fenced code block in markdown (do not include backticks inside quotation marks)>
   * Comment: <Explanation of why this code block is incorrect or problematic>
* Quote: <Exact code block 2, rendered as a fenced code block in markdown (do not include backticks inside quotation marks)>
   * Comment: <Explanation of why this code block is incorrect or problematic>
* Quote: <Exact sentence(s) 1 from other papers [hyperlinked citation]>
   * Comment: <Explanation of how this sentence contradicts the paper you are reviewing>
* Quote: <Exact sentence(s) 2 from other papers [hyperlinked citation]>
   * Comment: <Explanation of how this sentence contradicts the paper you are reviewing>
(There may be more or fewer evidence items depending on the available evidence.)

#### Concrete Action Item
* Action type: <One of: "Fix the writing" OR "Add new implementation">

For "Fix the writing" with replacement text:
* Original text: <exact text from the paper to be modified, quoted verbatim>
* Suggested text: <the corrected/improved replacement text>
* Location: <section name and paragraph reference, e.g., "Section 3.2, paragraph 2">

For "Fix the writing" with a new paragraph to add:
* Location: <where to insert, e.g., "After paragraph 3 in Section 4.2">
* New paragraph: <full paragraph text following the paper's writing style, with citations as [[N]](#refN)>

For "Add new implementation":
* Description: <detailed description of what additional experiment/implementation to add and why>
* Key code changes: <summary of core code modifications needed, with specific function/file references>
* Files modified: <comma-separated list of files that need changes>
* Run command: <bash command(s) the user can run to execute the suggested experiment>
(Use only one of the three variants above, matching the action type.)
```
5. Each comment should be 5-7 sentences long (a single paragraph), providing a concrete explanation of why the evidence supports the claim. Comments must be specific but not overly verbose.
6. Insert two empty lines between each item to separate them.


### Required structure and format of the citation list
The citation list must be formatted as follows:
```
#### Citation List
[1] Author(s), "Title," Venue, Year. [Link](https://url-to-paper)
[2] Author(s), "Title," Venue, Year. [Link](https://url-to-paper)
[3] Author(s), "Title," Venue, Year. [Link](https://url-to-paper)
...
(There may be more or fewer citations depending on the available citations.)
```
Each citation must include a hyperlinked URL to the source. In the body of the review, reference citations as [[1]](#ref1), [[2]](#ref2), etc.
There should be at least five citations in the citation list.
IMPORTANT: Every citation in the citation list MUST be referenced at least once in the evidence sections above. Do not include citations that are not used in the review — the citation list should only contain references that directly support your claims.
The citations could be academic papers, blog posts, news articles, datasets, code repositories, and other relevant sources.
Don't simply include papers that are cited in the paper you are reviewing.
It is very recommended to send a search query, read through the retrieved material, and based on that, iteratively send additional search queries and gather the most crucial pieces of evidence to support your review.
{ref_date_badge_instruction}

### Evaluation criteria (ordered by importance)
{criteria_text}

Note that the earlier evaluation criteria should be prioritized when deciding the items in the review over the later evaluation criteria.
For instance, assessing based on the first criterion should be prioritized over other ones, followed by the second, and so on.
Also, as a reminder, you could output less than {max_items} items if the paper contains no significant issues upon inspecting the paper based on these criteria.
{future_ref_instruction}

### TODO List for writing your review
- [ ] Read through the paper, supplementary files, and images and construct a potential list of items you will criticize.
- [ ] Read through the paper's code, check the functionality of each file, and attempt to execute the code if possible (unless the code is non-executable or resource-prohibitive).
- [ ] Write verification code that validates the key claims you make in your review. Save all verification code files in the "[LINK TO THE PAPER]/../review/verification_code_[MODEL NAME]" directory. Each claim that involves a quantitative, reproducibility, or methodological issue should have corresponding code that demonstrates or checks the problem (e.g., re-run a calculation, check statistical tests, verify dataset properties, or reproduce a computation the paper claims).
- [ ] Devise a list of search queries to find relevant literature. If search tools are unavailable, note that you cannot perform this step.
- [ ] Retrieve relevant papers (using tavily search tool), read them, and update your list of criticisms.
- [ ] (Very Important) Iterate through your list and ensure each potential criticism is factually correct, significant, and eligible for inclusion. Remove the items that are not eligible for inclusion and then sort the remaining items by their importance.
- [ ] Write the review in markdown format and save it to "[LINK TO THE PAPER]/../review/review_[MODEL NAME].md".
Note that you could re-do the steps that you have already done in an iterative manner to improve the quality of your review.


### Guidelines for opening the paper files
The directory to the paper you will be reviewing is [LINK TO THE PAPER].
Do not open any files in "[LINK TO THE PAPER]/../review" except when writing the review in "[LINK TO THE PAPER]/../review/review_[MODEL NAME].md".
The directory structure is as follows:
```
preprint/
├── preprint.md
│   └── (Main paper in Markdown)
│
├── images_list.json  (optional)
│   └── (Json file listing the images and their captions)
│
├── images/
│   └── (Images used in the main paper)
│
├── supplementary/  (optional)
│   ├── supplementary.md
│   │   └── (Supplementary document in Markdown)
│   │
│   └── images/
│       └── (Images used in the supplementary materials)
│
└── code/  (optional)
    └── (Source code referenced in the paper)
```


### Guidelines for reading the paper's code
1. The code may include a README file that explains the purpose of the code and how to run it. Check it before trying to run the code.
2. If the code is not executable, you should try to resolve dependencies, download the necessary datasets, and run the code to validate the claims you make.
3. Do not try to run the code if it is non-executable or resource-prohibitive.


### Guidelines for retrieving literature
1. Do not try to iterate through all the papers included in the paper's references. Instead, determine which papers are most relevant to write a good review.
2. Be proactive and add search queries to find relevant literature during your overall review process.
3. It is recommended not only to retrieve academic papers, but also to retrieve blog posts, news articles, datasets, code repositories, and other relevant sources.
4. Ensure that you actually read what you retrieved in order to write a good review.


### Tips
1. The paper's markdown may contain OCR errors. Do not assume the paper is incorrect solely because of OCR mistakes. Instead, infer the content from the potentially imperfect markdown text. Hence, do not point out about that manuscript is incomplete due to formatting issues.
2. The link to the images in the paper's markdown may be incorrect. Instead, there is guarantee that the images are listed properly as "figure1.png", "figure2.png", etc. Hence, do not point out about broken and missing figure assets.
3. The code you are reviewing does not need to be perfect; focus on major issues such as non-reproducible experiments or mismatches with descriptions instead of minor issues such as bad formatting, hard-coded paths, not accessible links to code, and bad documentation. Also, the code should be used to support the criticisms you make, and the main focus shouldn't be on the code itself.
4. When refining your review (as specified in the TODO list), please ensure that all the items in the review are factually correct, significant, and mutually exclusive to each other.
5. For "Fix the writing" action items, the original text must be an exact quote from the paper, and the suggested text must be a corrected version that fully addresses the criticism. Write enough text to make the fix self-contained. If a new paragraph is needed, write it following the paper's existing style and citation format.
6. For "Add new implementation" action items, focus on the minimal but complete changes needed. The run command should be directly executable. Also save the actual implementation code in the verification_code directory.
