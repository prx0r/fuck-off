"""End-to-end cascade scenarios beyond the happy-path append.

Each test boots the full cascade (writer → watchdog → md_change_state →
worker → LanceDB) against a tmp memory_root and asserts md/LanceDB
convergence after a specific perturbation. Scanner interval is held
at 60s here so the watcher path is the one being exercised — the
scanner-fallback variants live in :mod:`test_cascade_scanner_fallback`.

Coverage targets
----------------
* Rename: in-bucket / out-of-glob / cross-owner ``mv`` of a real md
  file (not the atomic-replace one — that one's covered by
  :mod:`test_cascade_fsevents_repro`).
* Content edits: re-writing an existing entry's body must flip
  ``content_sha256`` and trigger LanceDB re-upsert (not skip).
* Isolation: concurrent writes to N different owners must not bleed
  across each other's md_paths in LanceDB.
* Lap race: ``writer.append`` calls overlapping a worker's
  in-flight handler must all converge once drained, no entries lost.
