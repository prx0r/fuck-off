//! Surrogate-keyed, collection-scoped BFS.
//!
//! The string-keyed traversals materialize a node name for every visited node —
//! and, through `neighbors_in_collection`, one for every *edge* they walk. That
//! is the wrong currency for cross-engine work. Vector, FTS and spatial all
//! produce surrogates, so a graph result keyed on names has to be translated
//! back before it can meet them, which is exactly the per-query translation the
//! global surrogate exists to remove.
//!
//! This walk stays in the surrogate domain from end to end: it seeds from
//! surrogates, expands over the dense `u32` CSR ids, and returns a
//! [`SurrogateBitmap`] plus per-surrogate hop distances. The bitmap intersects
//! directly with any other engine's. Node names are resolved once, by the
//! caller, and only for the rows that survive fusion.
