//! Cross-runtime waker integration.
//!
//! The hardest part of the bridge: when the SPSC queue transitions between
//! states (full→not-full, empty→not-empty), the sleeping side must be woken
//! across the runtime boundary.
//!
//! ## Problem
//!
//! - Tokio wakers are `Send + Sync` (they post to Tokio's work-stealing scheduler).
//! - Glommio/monoio wakers are `!Send` (they are core-local eventfd or io_uring CQE).
//!
//! We cannot store a `!Send` Glommio waker inside the shared ring buffer state
//! (which is `Send + Sync`).
//!
//! ## Solution
//!
//! Use an **eventfd** as the cross-runtime signal. Both runtimes can poll an fd:
//!
//! - Producer (Tokio) writes 1 to eventfd when it pushes to a previously-empty queue.
//! - Consumer (TPC) reads from eventfd to wake up.
//! - Consumer (TPC) writes 1 to a *separate* eventfd when it pops from a previously-full queue.
//! - Producer (Tokio) reads from that eventfd to wake up.
//!
//! This avoids storing any `!Send` waker in shared state. The eventfd is an OS
//! primitive that both runtimes can integrate with their respective event loops.

use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};

/// Signal for waking the consumer when new data is available.
///
/// In production this will wrap an `eventfd` file descriptor.
