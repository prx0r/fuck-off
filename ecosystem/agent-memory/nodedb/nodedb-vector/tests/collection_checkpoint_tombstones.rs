//! Soft-deletes in growing / building segments must survive checkpoint restore.
//!
//! Spec: `delete(id)` on a vector in the growing segment (or a building
//! segment awaiting HNSW completion) tombstones the vector. Checkpoints
//! MUST serialize that tombstone, and `from_checkpoint` MUST apply it so
//! the restored collection reports the same `live_count()` and excludes
//! the deleted vector from `search()` results.
//!
//! Today:
//!   - `FlatIndex::get_vector` returns `Some(..)` even for tombstoned
//!     slots, so `growing_deleted` is serialized as all-false.
//!   - `from_checkpoint` ignores the `growing_deleted` field entirely and
//!     re-inserts every vector as live.
//!
//! Result: crash recovery silently resurrects soft-deleted rows — a
//! correctness regression for any workflow using `valid_until` deletes.
