//! The `NodeDb` trait: unified query interface for both Origin and Lite.
//!
//! Application code writes against this trait once. The runtime determines
//! whether queries execute locally (in-memory engines on Lite) or remotely
//! (pgwire to Origin).
//!
//! All methods are `async` — on native this runs on Tokio, on WASM this
//! runs on `wasm-bindgen-futures`.
//!
//! This file must remain a single block for object-safety: Rust does not
//! permit a `trait` body to be split across files. Splitting `NodeDb` into
//! supertraits would break the `Arc<dyn NodeDb>` pattern all callers depend
//! on and is therefore out of scope for any mechanical refactor.
