//! Canonical output names for aggregate expressions.
//!
//! One aggregate has two names: the *canonical* key it is computed and stored
//! under in a finalized group row (`sum(amount)`), and the *user alias* the
//! client sees (`SELECT SUM(amount) AS total`). The rename to the user alias
//! happens last, after HAVING has filtered, so anything that has to address an
//! aggregate mid-pipeline must use the canonical key. Deriving that key in one
//! place keeps the planner's HAVING rewrite and the physical spec builder from
//! drifting into two different names for the same column.
