//! Parser for `{ key: value }` object literal syntax.
//!
//! Two contracts live here, and the difference between them is the point:
//! [`parse_object_literal`] reads one literal off the FRONT of its input and
//! leaves the rest alone, while [`parse_object_literal_complete`] requires the
//! literal to be the whole input and reports anything left over. A caller whose
//! input is supposed to be the literal must use the strict form, or a clause the
//! author wrote is discarded without anyone being told.
