//! The one shaping rule for a key-value entry's `(key, value)` byte pair.
//!
//! Lives here, beside `inject_str_field`, because BOTH execution planes need
//! it: the Data Plane shapes scan results and a write's `RETURNING` projection,
//! and the Control Plane shapes a single-key `Get` response. It is a pure byte
//! transform — no I/O, no shared state, no runtime — so a single definition
//! crosses that boundary without touching plane separation, which governs
//! tokio/io_uring and shared mutable state rather than pure helpers.
//!
//! One definition is the point. Two copies of this rule already existed and
//! silently diverged: one of them appended raw bytes verbatim into a msgpack
//! map, and every scan path served `value: 118` for a stored `"v1"`.

/// Shape a KV entry into the canonical `{key, value…}` msgpack row.
///
/// Two storage shapes coexist by design, and the difference between them is
/// the whole reason this function exists:
///
/// - **MessagePack map** (typed columns): `key` is injected into the existing
///   map at the binary level, no decode/re-encode roundtrip. A body that
///   already carries its own `key` field keeps it — the stored row is
///   authoritative for its own primary key.
/// - **Raw bytes** (the single-`value` column form, and RESP `SET`): the bytes
///   are NOT msgpack at all, so they are wrapped as a msgpack STRING under
///   `value`. Appending them verbatim instead would hand a msgpack decoder a
///   non-msgpack body — which does not error: it reads the first byte as a
///   scalar and discards the rest, so `"v1"` decodes as the integer 118
///   (ASCII `'v'`). A decoder that succeeds on the wrong format is exactly the
///   failure this wrapping prevents.
///
/// Raw values may be non-UTF-8 (RESP `SET` accepts arbitrary bytes), so the
/// lossy view is taken: a SQL `SELECT` over binary values is already degraded
/// by the pgwire text protocol, and this keeps the output well-formed msgpack
/// rather than merely different-but-still-broken.
