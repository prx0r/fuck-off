//! Constraint validator — checks deltas against committed state.

//! This is the core of the CRDT/SQL bridge. When a delta arrives from a peer,
//! the validator checks all applicable constraints against the leader's
//! committed state. If any constraint is violated, the delta is rejected
//! with a compensation hint.
