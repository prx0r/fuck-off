//! Durability of the two syscalls that stand between an acknowledged write and
//! stable storage: the fsync of the segment file, and the fsync of the
//! directory holding that segment's name.
//!
//! Both have a failure mode that looks like success from the outside — a retry
//! over an already-emptied buffer, and a discarded directory-fsync result —
//! and both lose records that a client was told were committed.
//!
//! Requires `--features failpoints`; without it the injections compile away
//! and there is nothing to drive.
