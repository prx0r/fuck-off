//! A mid-file corruption detected during recovery files a black-box report

//!
//! The point of preserving the segment is that the failure is not
//! reproducible: the bytes that prove what went wrong exist only on the machine
//! that hit it, and only until something repairs or rolls the log. The report
//! has to hold a copy or the evidence is gone.
