//! WAL durability stress test.

//! Spawns 8 independent writer threads, each owning its own WAL file.
//! After all writes are durable, truncates each file to a seeded-random
//! offset within the last group-commit window to simulate a mid-fsync
//! power loss. Then opens each file with the recovery path and asserts:
//!
//! - Recovered record count is contiguous from LSN 1.
//! - No records beyond what was synced are fabricated.
//! - All recovered records pass the built-in checksum check (WalReader
//!   already enforces this; stopping before a torn record is enough).
