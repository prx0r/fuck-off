//! Multi-segment replay over mmap'd WAL segments.
//!
//! Concatenating segments is only safe if two things hold: each segment stops
//! where the log really ends (not at a hole with committed records behind it),
//! and no segment has gone missing from between the ones that survive. The
//! first is [`crate::torn_tail::verify_committed_prefix`], the second is
//! [`SegmentContinuity`]. A replay that starts mid-log needs a third: the
//! records it asks for must still be retained at all, which
//! [`check_retained_floor`] decides. All three are applied here so the Event
//! Plane's catchup path cannot observe a silently shortened log.
