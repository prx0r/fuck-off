//! Segmented WAL: manages a directory of segment files with automatic rollover
//! and truncation.
//!
//! This is the primary WAL interface for production use. It wraps `WalWriter`
//! and `WalReader` to provide:
//!
//! - Automatic segment rollover when the active segment exceeds a target size.
//! - Truncation of old segments after checkpoint confirmation.
//! - Transparent multi-segment replay for crash recovery.
//! - Legacy single-file WAL migration.
//!
//! ## Thread safety
//!
//! `SegmentedWal` is NOT `Send + Sync` by itself. The `WalManager` in the main
//! crate wraps it in a `Mutex` for thread-safe access from the Control Plane.
