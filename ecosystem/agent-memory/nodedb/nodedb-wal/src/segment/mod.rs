//! WAL segment management.
//!
//! The WAL is split into fixed-size segment files for efficient truncation.
//! Each segment is a standalone WAL file containing records within an LSN range.
//!
//! ## Naming convention
//!
//! Segments are named `wal-{first_lsn:020}.seg` — zero-padded for lexicographic
//! ordering. This guarantees `ls` and `readdir` return segments in LSN order.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. Writer creates a new segment when the current segment exceeds `target_size`.
//! 2. The active segment is the one being appended to.
//! 3. `truncate_before(lsn)` deletes all sealed segments whose `max_lsn < lsn`.
//! 4. The active segment is NEVER deleted — only sealed (closed) segments are eligible.
//!
//! ## Recovery
//!
//! On startup, all segment files in the WAL directory are discovered via `readdir`,
//! sorted by first_lsn, and replayed in order. The last segment is the active one.
