//! Alignment padding records.
//!
//! O_DIRECT requires every write to be a multiple of the device block size, so
//! the tail of a flush batch is padded out to the next boundary and the file
//! offset advances by the padded length. The bytes in that gap are not part of
//! any record.
//!
//! Leaving the gap unframed breaks replay. A reader walks records back to back,
//! so it lands on the padding and tries to parse it as a record header — the
//! bytes are stale content from a previous batch (the write buffer is reused
//! without being re-zeroed), and even all-zero padding fails the magic check.
//! The reader treats that as the end of the committed prefix, so a segment
//! holding more than one flush batch replays only its first batch.
//!
//! Padding is therefore framed as a record: the gap is filled with a `Noop`
//! whose payload is zeroes, keeping the record chain continuous across batch
//! boundaries so every reader walks the whole segment. Padding records carry
//! LSN 0, are never mirrored into the double-write buffer, and are skipped by
//! all readers rather than surfaced to replay.
