//! Segment-file opening, with `O_DIRECT` support detection.
//!
//! `O_DIRECT` is rejected at `open(2)` with `EINVAL` on most overlayfs
//! configurations and on many network filesystems (and on tmpfs before Linux
//! 6.1, which added support for it). That failure is
//! reported as a distinct error rather than folded into a generic I/O error,
//! and it is never repaired by quietly reopening the segment buffered: the WAL
//! bypasses the page cache so its durability does not depend on writeback, and
//! a silent downgrade would take that guarantee away with nothing to observe.
