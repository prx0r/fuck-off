//! `INSERT ... RETURNING` on the vector engine (`primary='vector'` collections).
//!
//! A vector-primary row lives in two stores: the vector itself in the HNSW
//! graph, and every other column in a sparse-store sidecar keyed by the row's
//! surrogate in hex. Only the sidecar is readable as a row — `attach_body`
//! fetches it by that key and the response translator flattens it — so the
//! sidecar is what a `RETURNING` projection must report.
//!
//! The sidecar holds `zerompk` TAGGED bytes (`Value::String(s)` encodes as
//! `[4,"…"]`), stored verbatim by the upsert handler. Decoding them as an
//! ordinary document body yields tag arrays instead of values, which is the
//! same failure that once made a stored `"v1"` read back as the integer 118.
