//! Authorization and policy handling for `MATCH` pattern queries.
//!
//! A MATCH walks a collection's edges and returns bindings over its nodes, so
//! it carries the same read grant the collection's rows do. Both dispatch
//! shapes (single-node broadcast, cluster scatter) reach the Data Plane without
//! a plan the planner's authorization and RLS passes can inspect, so the
//! handler has to reach those verdicts itself.
//!
//! Bindings are topology, not row bodies, so there is nothing for a row filter
//! to evaluate: a read policy refuses the query outright. A pattern with no
//! `IN '<collection>'` may walk anything the tenant holds, so it is authorized
//! against every collection it could touch and refuses while any read policy
//! applies to the caller.
