//! Write-admission fence tests.
//!
//! The fast-path point-write gate and the deterministic Calvin scheduler share
//! ONE per-vShard lock table (`SharedState::calvin_lock_managers`). These tests
//! drive the gate directly against that shared table to prove the fence:
//!
//! - A point write whose key is held by a pending commit (a normal Calvin-band
//!   `TxnId` acquired and not released) is NOT admitted to the fast path — it is
//!   routed to the scheduler, which queues it FIFO behind the holder. Once the
//!   commit releases, the same write is admitted fast.
//! - Two concurrent point writes to the same key serialize: the first takes the
//!   fast path holding the lock; the second observes that lock and is routed.
//!
//! The routed write's actual apply is delegated to the existing
//! `submit_calvin_routed` primitive (exercised end-to-end by the Calvin executor
//! test suite); these tests assert the gate's fence DECISION, which is the piece
//! this change introduces.
