//! Engine memory accounting must remain balanced across a full
//! lifecycle of `CREATE → INSERT → DROP`.
//!
//! `Budget::release()` saturates to zero on over-release and emits a
//! `tracing::warn!` — silent in test output, but the real symptom on
//! origin deployments is a continuous "memory release exceeds
//! allocation" log every ~40 s. The dual call-site bug — releasing the
//! wrong size or skipping `acquire` — surfaces as drift in the global
//! `total_allocated()` counter once a workload's resources are fully
//! released.
//!
//! This test pins the invariant: after a known ingest is fully torn
//! down, the governor's accumulated allocation must return to its
//! pre-workload baseline (within a small tolerance for background
//! metadata).
