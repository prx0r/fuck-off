//! Bearer-JWT authentication on the HTTP API, exercised over a real socket.
//!
//! The HTTP bearer route runs on Tokio worker threads, so JWKS verification
//! has to be awaited rather than blocked on. Driving it with a nested
//! `block_on` aborts the request task, and the client observes a truncated
//! connection instead of any HTTP status — a failure mode no in-process call
//! to the resolver can reproduce.
//!
//! Both tests therefore issue a real request carrying
//! `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` and assert on the response:
//!
//! 1. A token minted by the node's configured provider authenticates and the
//!    route does its work (200 + a session handle).
//! 2. A well-formed token the registry cannot verify is refused with 401 —
//!    still a definite HTTP response, never a dropped connection.
