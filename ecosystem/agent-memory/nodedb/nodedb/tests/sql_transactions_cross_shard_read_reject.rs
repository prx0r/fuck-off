//! An interactive transaction that writes one vShard and reads a DIFFERENT
//! vShard is a cross-shard transaction at COMMIT time — even though the
//! buffered write batch itself is single-shard — and on a node with NO Calvin
//! sequencer wired it is rejected. This covers the sequencer-absent path:
//! embedded/local mode (which never stands up Calvin) and an Origin node with
//! `single_node_calvin = false`. A default Origin node stands up the
//! single-node Calvin sequencer and commits this transaction atomically
//! instead; this harness builds a server without a sequencer, so it exercises
//! the rejection path directly.
//!
//! The interactive-COMMIT orchestrator (`run_commit`, in
//! `control/server/shared/session/commit.rs`) widens `classify_dispatch`'s
//! participant set with the session's read-set vShards
//! (`read_vshards_of(&read_set)`) before classifying the buffered write
//! batch. A transaction that only ever wrote collection A (one vShard) but
//! also read collection B (a DIFFERENT vShard) therefore classifies as
//! `DispatchClass::MultiShard { vshards: {A, B} }` at COMMIT time. On a real
//! cluster this whole batch commits atomically through the Calvin barrier;
//! but this test runs against a standalone (non-cluster) `TestServer` with no
//! sequencer wired, so the strict cross-shard COMMIT path surfaces
//! `Error::SequencerUnavailable` ("cross-shard transactions require a cluster
//! deployment with the Calvin sequencer"). Previously the buffered batch
//! alone (containing only the write to A) classified as `SingleShard` and
//! committed on the fast path without ever considering the read of B.
