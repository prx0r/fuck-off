//! The full-text-search read path must decode a row's body with the encoding
//! its collection actually uses, and must gate it on policy rather than on a
//! format mismatch.
//!
//! Three encodings share the sparse store: schemaless document bodies
//! (standard MessagePack), strict document bodies (Binary Tuples), and
//! vector-primary metadata sidecars (`zerompk` TAGGED
//! `HashMap<String, Value>`). A tagged map and a plain document map are both
//! valid MessagePack maps beginning with the same map header, so no inspection
//! of the stored bytes can tell them apart — a reader that sniffs necessarily
//! mis-decodes one and hands back `[4,"alice"]` where the caller asked for
//! `alice`.
//!
//! Two independent failures are pinned here, because they are two different
//! consequences of the same missing input:
//!
//! - **Projection.** The BM25 score scan returns EVERY row of the collection
//!   (a row with no hit gets a null score), so it reads vector-primary
//!   sidecars whether or not the inverted index holds anything for the
//!   collection. Decoded as document bodies, their payload columns render as
//!   tag arrays.
//! - **Row-level security.** The policy predicate must run against the
//!   NORMALIZED image — the same bytes the projection sees — so the gate and
//!   the output agree. Run against the stored bytes, a strict Binary Tuple
//!   exposes no field the predicate recognizes, so every row is dropped: the
//!   check fails closed on a format mismatch rather than on policy, and an
//!   FTS search under any read policy returns nothing at all.
