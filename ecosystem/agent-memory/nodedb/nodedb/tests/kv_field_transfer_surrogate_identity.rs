//! Regression test for cross-engine identity on the two remaining KV
//! value-computing write-back paths that previously hard-coded
//! `Surrogate::ZERO`: the field-atomic merge (`FieldSet`, reached via a KV
//! `UPDATE`) and the atomic transfer (`TRANSFER`, which moves a value between a
//! debit key and a credit key).
//!
//! Every row in every engine carries a stable global u32 surrogate allocated
//! from the WAL-durable, Raft-replicated counter and content-addressed on the
//! row's primary key. Cross-engine prefilter/join is a roaring-bitmap
//! intersection over those surrogates, so a KV row touched by these ops MUST
//! own a real, non-zero surrogate — the same one a normal insert of that key
//! would allocate. A transfer touches TWO rows (debit + credit), and each must
//! get ITS OWN distinct surrogate — collapsing both onto one identity would be
//! the very bug this guards against, one level over.
//!
//! As with the `Incr`/`Cas`/`GetSet` family, this is NOT observable through a
//! plain `SELECT ... WHERE key=X` (KV point-gets resolve by raw key bytes). The
//! authoritative observation is the persisted PK->surrogate map: the fix makes
//! the Control Plane allocate + persist a binding per touched key at plan
//! construction; the bug never called the assigner on these paths, so the
//! catalog map is missing the affected binding(s).
