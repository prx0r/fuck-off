//! Authorization and policy handling for the version-history read family.
//!
//! `SELECT … AT VERSION` returns a document's merged state at a version and
//! `SELECT DIFF(…)` returns the oplog delta those states were built from —
//! both are stored row content, so both carry the collection's read grant, and
//! both now reach the Data Plane through the authorized door rather than the
//! system door reserved for work with no user behind it.
//!
//! `SHOW VERSIONS OF` is read straight from the catalog: checkpoint names,
//! their creators, and their timestamps describe a document in the collection,
//! so disclosing them takes the same grant the document does.
//!
//! None of the three carries a row a filter could be evaluated against, so all
//! three refuse while a read policy applies rather than returning a payload the
//! policy cannot narrow.
