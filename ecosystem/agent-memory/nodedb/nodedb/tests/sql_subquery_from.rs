//! Derived-table subqueries in the `FROM` clause.
//!
//! The bench triage flagged that `FROM (SELECT ...) AS t` is rejected
//! with `unsupported: multi-table FROM without JOIN` — the planner is
//! mistaking the parenthesised SELECT for a second base relation.
//! Derived tables are SQL-standard syntax and the planner must
//! materialise them as the source for the outer SELECT.
//!
//! Tests below verify that derived FROM:
//!  1. plans + executes without error
//!  2. exposes the inner row count (filters / GROUP BY take effect)
//!  3. carries inner aggregate values through to the outer projection
//!
//! Some orthogonal data-correctness paths (`SELECT DISTINCT` on
//! `document_strict`, ORDER BY after GROUP BY) are known-broken at
//! the planner level and surface as separate findings — these tests
//! avoid relying on them so they fail only on a derived-FROM
//! regression.
