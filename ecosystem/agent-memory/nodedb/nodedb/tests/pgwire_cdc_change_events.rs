//! pgwire SQL DML must raise Control-Plane CDC change events.
//!
//! ## The bug this guards against
//!
//! Every pgwire SQL write funnelled through `dispatch_local` submitted with no
//! change-feed owner, so `publish_change_event` was never reached from the SQL
//! path at all. `ChangeStream` subscribers — HTTP `/cdc`, WS-RPC live queries,
//! `SHOW CHANGES` — observed NOTHING from SQL DML, for every engine. Only the
//! internal autocommit funnel published, and no user SQL statement reaches it.
//!
//! This is distinct from the Event-Plane CDC / AFTER-trigger path, which is fed
//! by the Data Plane's `emit_write_event` and worked throughout: two separate
//! streams, only one of which was broken.
//!
//! ## Test shape
//!
//! Subscribe to the Control-Plane change stream BEFORE writing, then run
//! INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE over a real `tokio_postgres` client and assert one
//! event per statement, in statement order, with the right operation kind.
//! Single node: `cluster_transport` is `None`, so no NOTIFY broadcast is
//! involved and every event observed here was published locally by the write
//! funnel. Before the fix this test times out on the first `recv_filtered`.
