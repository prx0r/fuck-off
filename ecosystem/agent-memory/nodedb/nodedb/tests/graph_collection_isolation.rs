//! Cross-collection isolation: the in-memory graph CSR.
//!
//! Regression for the bug where two graph-enabled collections in the same
//! `(database, tenant)` shared ONE in-memory CSR adjacency index with no
//! collection axis, so a `MATCH ... IN <collA>` (and GraphRAG expansion, which
//! both read the CSR via the collection-scoped neighbor primitive) walked edges
//! inserted under `<collB>`.
//!
//! The fix tags every CSR edge with the collection it was inserted under
//! (nodes, node-labels and surrogates stay shared across collections — only
//! edges carry the collection axis) and filters the collection-scoped read
//! paths by it. These tests exercise that primitive directly: one CSR
//! partition (one database/tenant) holding TWO collections, asserting a
//! collection-scoped read sees only its own edges while the index's own
//! unscoped read still sees the merged graph. That merged view is an internal
//! primitive, not a statement: every client traversal names a collection, since
//! one that named none could not be authorized.
//!
//! Pre-fix these assertions cannot hold: the CSR had no per-edge collection
//! tag, so a collection-scoped read of collection A necessarily also returned
//! collection B's edges.
