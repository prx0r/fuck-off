//! Integration coverage for `rrf_score()` SQL function projection.
//!
//! The bug class fixed here spanned four layers, each silently dropping or
//! misnaming the score that the user asked for:
//!
//! 1. Planner: `apply_order_by` only looked at the literal ORDER BY expression
//!    for a `rrf_score(...)` call; an ORDER BY referencing a SELECT alias
//!    (`ORDER BY score DESC` against `SELECT … rrf_score(…) AS score`) never
//!    matched the trigger, so the plan stayed a plain Scan and the column
//!    resolved to NULL via scalar evaluation that has no implementation.
//! 2. Planner: there was no SELECT-projection path — `SELECT id, rrf_score(…)
//!    AS score FROM c WHERE … LIMIT N` (no ORDER BY at all) had no entry path
//!    into hybrid-search detection.
//! 3. Plan + executor: `SqlPlan::HybridSearch` and `TextOp::HybridSearch`
//!    carried no alias field; even when the trigger fired, `HybridSearchHit`
//!    serialized the score under the fixed name `rrf_score` regardless of the
//!    caller's `AS <alias>`.
//! 4. pgwire shaping: `TextOp::Search` and `TextOp::HybridSearch` were missing
//!    from the `MultiRow` `PlanKind`, so search responses fell through to
//!    `PlanKind::Execution` — the row payload was discarded entirely and the
//!    client received an "OK" execution tag with no rows.
//!
//! Plus a fifth invariant: the no-args shape `rrf_score()` previously fell
//! through to scalar evaluation (no implementation) and surfaced NULL silently.
//! It now returns a typed `InvalidFunction` error at parse time.
