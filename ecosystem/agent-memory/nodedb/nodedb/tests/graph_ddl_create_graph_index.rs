//! `CREATE GRAPH INDEX` DDL correctness contracts.
//!
//! The tree-index builder (`nodedb/src/control/server/shared/ddl/neutral/tree_ops/`)
//! must satisfy three invariants that the current implementation violates:
//!
//! 1. Edge dispatch is batched per hop, not one awaited RPC per document.
//! 2. Any `Err` from edge insert propagates as a DDL failure — no silent
//!    warn-and-continue — and `schema_version` does NOT advance on failure.
//! 3. The build emits a WAL record so a crash mid-build is replayable.
//!
//! The Phase-2 failing test here locks in invariant 1 (batched dispatch,
//! observable as a wall-clock budget). Invariants 2 and 3 get their own
//! tests in Phase 4 once fault-injection hooks land.
