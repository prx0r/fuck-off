//! Regression coverage: outbound HTTP emitters (alert webhooks, SIEM
//! webhooks, OTEL exporter) must reuse one `reqwest::Client` rather than
//! constructing a fresh one per call.
//!
//! Every `reqwest::Client::builder().build()` allocates a connection pool,
//! DNS resolver, rustls config, and TLS session cache. Under burst, that
//! means a SYN flood and a CPU pegged by TLS handshakes — the pooled
//! connection is discarded right after use.
//!
//! The webhook-delivery task at `event/webhook/delivery.rs` already holds
//! one client per stream. The fix extends that pattern: a single
//! `Arc<reqwest::Client>` lives on `SharedState` and is handed to every
//! emitter. This file pins the public shape of that contract.
