//! Wire-level coverage for the session-handle resolver's missing
//! hygiene layer: rate limiting + visibility on miss.
//!
//! Today, `SET LOCAL nodedb.auth_session = '<handle>'` on a pgwire connection
//! silently tries to resolve the handle with no per-connection throttle and
//! no observable signal on miss — a misconfigured client or a stolen-handle
//! probe can hammer the resolver indefinitely. Acceptance specifies:
//!
//! > simulate 100 failed `SET LOCAL nodedb.auth_session` calls → connection
//! > closed with pgwire error; audit event recorded.
//!
//! This file encodes that acceptance at the wire boundary — no assumption
//! about internal API names, method signatures, or struct fields. The test
//! compiles against today's code, fails today (server silently accepts all
//! 100 attempts), and passes once the rate-limit + audit plumbing lands,
//! regardless of how the fix is shaped internally.
