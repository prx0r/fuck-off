//! Affected-row counts on autocommit DML must be REPORTED by the write that

//!
//! A client reads the count out of the pgwire `CommandComplete` tag (`DELETE n`
//! / `UPDATE n`) and uses it to answer "did my statement touch a row?" — an ORM
//! turns it directly into the boolean its `delete` / `update` returns. That
//! answer is only usable when the count is derived from the actual mutation
//! outcome, so every case below asserts the count against the observable state
//! (`SELECT count(*)`) rather than against the plan's expectation.
//!
//! The counts covered here span every point-write engine surface that can
//! legitimately match nothing: schemaless document, strict document, key-value,
//! CRDT documents, `DELETE ... RETURNING`, and the predicate (non-PK) path.
