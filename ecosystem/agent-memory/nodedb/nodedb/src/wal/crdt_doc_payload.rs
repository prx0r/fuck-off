//! Self-describing WAL payload for CRDT document-row records
//! (`CrdtOp::DocUpsert` / `DocDelete`).
//!
//! These ops mutate a top-level `LoroMap` row and live in the Data Plane. The
//! Data Plane never appends to the WAL, and the delta cannot be computed in the
//! Control Plane (it has no `LoroDoc`), so this record carries the **intent** —
//! collection, document, surrogate, fields, and (for upsert) the partial flag —
//! rather than a Loro delta. Replay re-executes the exact same live handler
//! (`execute_crdt_doc_upsert` / `_delete`) that ran when the write was first
//! accepted, exactly the "log the predicate, re-apply deterministically"
//! contract `CrdtListOpWalRecord` uses for the block-list ops.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT `RecordType::CrdtDelta`: that record type's replay contract
//! is idempotent, commutative Loro import with no LSN gate. `DocUpsert` with
//! `partial = false` prunes absent keys (a full-projection replace), so its
//! effect is order-sensitive and does not fit `CrdtDelta`'s replay path.
//!
//! Each variant carries exactly the fields its operation needs — no
//! `Option<_>` fields that a truncated/corrupt record could decode with a
//! wrong-but-valid state.
