//! Replay arm for [`RecordType::TransactionRedo`] WAL records.
//!
//! A `TransactionRedo` record groups an ordered set of engine-native
//! sub-records ([`RedoSubRecord`]) — each already in the exact payload shape
//! that engine's own per-op WAL record uses. This module turns each
//! `TransactionRedo` back into a set of per-op [`WalRecord`]s and feeds them to
//! the SAME per-engine replay paths the standalone (autocommit) records use.
//!
//! ## Why reconstitute rather than apply a blob
//!
//! There is no global "skip records ≤ checkpoint LSN" barrier — each engine
//! self-manages idempotency (KV rebuilds from empty; columnar/timeseries gate on
//! their flushed-LSN watermark; array on its manifest's `durable_lsn`; vector /
//! spatial / FTS restore a checkpoint then replay). Routing every sub-record
//! through its engine's existing `replay_*_wal` inherits that per-engine
//! discipline exactly. Applying the redo record as one monolithic blob, or
//! bypassing an engine's replay function, would defeat it — re-applying a
//! columnar append a checkpoint already absorbed duplicates the row.
//!
//! ## Why the reconstituted ops are MERGED, not appended
//!
//! Most redo ops are absolute overwrites. Replaying every standalone
//! (autocommit) record first and then every redo sub-record inverts LSN order
//! for any key written both inside a transaction and by a later autocommit: the
//! transaction's older post-image lands last and recovery comes up holding it.
//! So [`CoreLoop::replay_engines_in_lsn_order`] merges the reconstituted
//! sub-records into the standalone stream and sorts by LSN before any engine
//! sees a record. Every engine arm then observes exactly the order the WAL
//! recorded, which is the order that produced the acknowledged state.
//!
//! ## Dispatch
//!
//! Each `replay_*_wal` already filters the slice it is handed by
//! `RecordType`, so the reconstituted records are handed to every engine arm
//! and each self-selects its own records. `RecordType::Put` / `Delete` are
//! shared by KV, document, and graph; those three arms disambiguate by payload
//! shape (KV by its leading string discriminator; document and graph by their
//! mutually-exclusive tuple shapes — see the `replay_document_redo` and
//! `replay_graph_redo` arms in `crate::data::executor`).
//!
//! `calvin_stamp` is ignored here: it is read only by the Calvin recovery scan,
//! never gates engine replay.
