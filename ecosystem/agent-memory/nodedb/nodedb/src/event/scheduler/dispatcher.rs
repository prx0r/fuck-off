//! Bounded job dispatcher for the scheduler.
//!
//! Three compounding hazards in the original `scheduler_loop`:
//!   * no shutdown observation inside spawned jobs — long-running bodies
//!     delay teardown and outlive `SharedState`;
//!   * no concurrency cap — schedules firing at the same minute-mark
//!     (`* * * * *` with `allow_overlap = true`) spawn unbounded parallel
//!     heavy SQL, starving request-path queries;
//!   * no memory ceiling — `execute_job` could materialise unbounded
//!     result sets through `execute_block`.
//!
//! `JobDispatcher` solves all three:
//!   * owns a shutdown `watch` handed to every spawned body;
//!   * owns a `Semaphore` sized to `max_concurrent_jobs` (extra tries fail
//!     fast with `DispatchOutcome::OverBudget`, rather than queueing);
//!   * rejects jobs whose declared result-set size exceeds
//!     `max_result_bytes` before any work is done.
