//! Event Plane consumer: one Tokio task per Data Plane core ring buffer.
//!
//! Each consumer operates in one of two modes:
//!
//! ```text
//! (boot: resume from persisted watermark)
//!         │
//!         ▼
//! WalCatchup ──[caught up to WAL head]──► Normal
//!   ▲                                       │
//!   └────────[sequence gap detected]────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! - **Normal**: polls ring buffer, processes events, persists watermark.
//! - **WalCatchup**: pauses ring buffer entirely, reads events exclusively
//!   from WAL on disk until caught up, then switches back. Ring buffer and
//!   WAL are NEVER read simultaneously (prevents "thundering WAL" spiral).
//!   The consumer also boots directly into this mode (see `consumer_loop`)
//!   to replay any WAL suffix past the persisted watermark before serving
//!   the ring buffer, closing the restart delivery gap. If that suffix is no
//!   longer in the WAL — truncated away, or unreachable because the watermark
//!   itself was lost — the node fail-stops rather than resume from a position
//!   it cannot prove it reached.
