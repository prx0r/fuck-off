//! Column redaction for the CDC events a change-stream subscriber receives.
//!
//! A [`CdcEvent`] carries the written row itself: `new_value`, the UPDATE
//! pre-image `old_value`, and the per-field diffs computed from the two. None
//! of those reach the named-projection shaping core where a query's rows are
//! redacted, so a subscriber would otherwise read stored columns that every
//! other delivery surface masks. The rules are applied here instead, through
//! the same shared hook, so the mask / hash / null semantics stay defined
//! exactly once.
//!
//! The router decodes the stored row bytes ONCE per `WriteEvent`
//! (`CdcRouter::route_event`), so by the time an event is deliverable these
//! payloads are already decoded `serde_json::Value` maps of stored fields — the
//! flat row map the SELECT path redacts, not the stored MessagePack bytes the
//! device-sync surfaces hand over.
//!
//! The scope a policy is keyed on belongs to the subscriber, never to the
//! event:
//!
//! - Control-Plane readers — the stream SELECT and the HTTP poll / SSE
//!   endpoints — are the authenticated caller, whose roles are resolved per
//!   request.
//! - Event-Plane deliveries — the webhook POST and Kafka publish tasks — have
//!   no request to resolve anything from. Their scope is the one an
//!   authenticated principal's `CREATE CHANGE STREAM` captured onto the
//!   subscription record itself
//!   (`ChangeStreamDef::subscriber_roles`), which the delivery task reads back
//!   from the stream registry. No identity is pulled across the Data→Event bus.
//!
//! A captured scope that carries no roles proves nothing about the destination:
//! the record may simply predate the field. Events of a collection some policy
//! protects are then withheld instead of delivered in the clear, per collection,
//! so a stream over unprotected collections still survives the upgrade.
//!
//! Rules are keyed per collection and a wildcard stream carries events from
//! many, so the resolved inputs are rebuilt only when consecutive events cross
//! a collection boundary.
