//! Per-engine "already durable through LSN X" floors recovered from on-disk
//! checkpoints at boot, consulted by WAL replay so a restored checkpoint is not
//! re-derived from records it already contains.
//!
//! ## Why replaying ABOVE the floor is safe
//!
//! Every KV WAL record replays either as an absolute overwrite (`kv_put`,
//! `kv_batch_put`, `kv_delete`, `kv_truncate`) or as a delta re-executed against
//! the engine's current state (`kv_incr`, `kv_cas`, `kv_field_set`,
//! `kv_transfer`, ...). Restoring a checkpoint durable through LSN F reproduces
//! exactly the engine state that existed after record F was applied, so feeding
//! the records above F back through the same replay paths — in LSN order, on top
//! of that state — reaches the state a full from-zero replay would.
//!
//! It is records at or below F that MUST be skipped. For the absolute-overwrite
//! records re-applying is merely redundant, but for the delta records it is
//! corruption: an increment already folded into the checkpoint would be counted
//! twice.
//!
//! ## Why a floor is engine-wide rather than per-collection
//!
//! A KV record can span two collections (`kv_transfer_item` moves a row between
//! them). With per-collection floors those two collections could disagree —
//! source covered, destination not — and the record is then unrepresentable:
//! skipping it drops the destination's insert, applying it double-debits the
//! source. Publishing every collection's file under one generation, named by a
//! single manifest, makes disagreement unreachable by construction: all live
//! collections advance to one LSN together or none do.
//!
//! ## Adding an engine
//!
//! Add a field to [`ReplayFloors`], populate it from that engine's
//! `load_*_checkpoints` boot path, and consult it from that engine's replay
//! arms. Nothing here needs reshaping — engines do not share a floor.
//!
//! ## Which engines need one
//!
//! Only those whose WAL records are DELTAS against current state. A floor is not
//! a general "I restored a checkpoint" marker, and adding one where replay is
//! already idempotent gates records for no reason.
//!
//! Six checkpointed engines deliberately have no field here:
//!
//! * Sparse vector — `SparseVectorPut` is an upsert keyed by `doc_id` and
//!   `SparseVectorDelete` is a no-op against an absent document, so a record
//!   re-applied over the restored index reproduces it.
//! * The sync idempotency gate — `SyncSeqAdvance` advances both its maps by
//!   max-wins, so re-folding a record already contained in the restored state
//!   cannot change it. What that restore needs instead is for replay to MERGE
//!   into it rather than replace it; see `install_sync_hwm_maps`.
//! * Graph node labels — `GraphNodeLabelSet` ORs a bit on and
//!   `GraphNodeLabelRemove` ANDs it off, both keyed by `(node, label)` NAME, so
//!   a record re-applied over the restored bitset lands on the same bit. The
//!   names are why: the restore keys by name rather than by local node id
//!   precisely because ids are not stable across restarts, and replay uses the
//!   same `add_node_label` / `remove_node_label` entry points as the live
//!   handler.
//! * The array engine — it carries its own per-array floor rather than one
//!   here: each array's manifest records the `durable_lsn` its flushed segments
//!   reach, and `replay_array_wal` gates on that. A shared engine-wide field
//!   would be wrong for it, since arrays flush independently of one another.
//! * Full-text search — `FtsIndex` rewrites the surrogate's posting, length and
//!   stats entries wholesale, deriving the corpus-counter deltas from the prior
//!   doc-length row read in the same write transaction, so a re-applied record
//!   lands on the state it already produced; `FtsDelete` decrements only when a
//!   prior length existed. See `wal_replay_fts.rs`, which proves it.
//! * Spatial — `SpatialPut` overwrites the surrogate's document body and
//!   replaces (rather than appends) its R-tree entry, guarded by the docmap the
//!   entry is always written with; `SpatialDelete` removes an absent entry as a
//!   no-op. See `wal_replay_spatial.rs`, which proves it.
//!
//! ## Why there is no general applied-LSN replay cursor
//!
//! A single durable "replay reached LSN X" cursor would look like it subsumes
//! all of the above. It does not, and it cannot be made correct here.
//!
//! The reason is that replay is not one write. A record's effect lands in
//! whichever engines it touches — a redb transaction, an in-memory HNSW graph,
//! an mmap'd tile segment — and no cursor write can be made atomic with all of
//! them at once. A cursor persisted before an engine absorbed the record skips
//! it forever on the next boot; persisted after, it is exactly the per-engine
//! floor already recorded here, only coarser: one engine's slow flush would
//! hold the shared cursor back for every other engine.
//!
//! What makes a cursor unnecessary is a property replay already holds: **WAL
//! replay never advances a DURABLE gate ahead of the state it describes.** Every
//! floor and watermark in this file is set from a checkpoint at boot or by a
//! completed flush — never by the act of replaying — and every durable side
//! effect replay itself performs is an overwrite keyed by identity (a surrogate
//! or a coordinate), not an accumulation. So a crash in the middle of replay
//! leaves nothing to reconcile: the in-memory work is simply gone, the durable
//! work is exactly what a repeat of it would produce, and the next boot restarts
//! from the same floors and converges on the same state. That is what makes
//! replay resumable, and it is a stronger guarantee than a cursor could give,
//! because it does not depend on a write ordering that spans engines.
//!
//! The obligation this places on new code is the one the per-engine notes
//! above discharge: an engine whose replay is a DELTA against current state, or
//! whose replay writes durable state non-idempotently, must gate itself — with
//! a floor here, or with a per-collection watermark it carries itself. It must
//! not assume a cursor will cover it.
