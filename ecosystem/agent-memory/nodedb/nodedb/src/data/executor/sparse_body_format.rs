//! Which encoding a collection's sparse-store rows use, resolved from the
//! collection's registered kind.
//!
//! Three encodings share the sparse store: schemaless document bodies (standard
//! MessagePack), strict document bodies (Binary Tuples), and vector-primary
//! metadata sidecars (`zerompk` TAGGED `HashMap<String, Value>`). A tagged map
//! and a plain document map are both valid MessagePack maps and begin with the
//! same map header, so no inspection of the stored bytes can separate them: a
//! reader that sniffs necessarily mis-decodes one of them, and returns
//! `[4,"alice"]` where the client asked for `alice`.
//!
//! So the decision is made once, here, from `doc_configs` — the registry the
//! DDL register broadcast and the boot seed both populate — and every reader
//! of a sparse body takes the answer as a parameter.
