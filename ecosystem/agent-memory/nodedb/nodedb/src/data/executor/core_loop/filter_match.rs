//! Storage-mode-aware `ScanFilter` predicate evaluation on a STORED row body.
//!
//! `ScanFilter::matches_binary` operates on MessagePack. Strict (Binary
//! Tuple) collections store rows in a different wire format, so a predicate
//! evaluated directly against the raw stored bytes of a strict row silently
//! never matches. Every caller that re-checks a scan predicate against a
//! stored body — the base document scan, the bulk DML base scan, and the
//! in-transaction predicate staging handlers (`stage_bulk_update`,
//! `stage_bulk_delete`) — must decode Binary Tuple bodies to MessagePack
//! first. This is the single, shared implementation of that decode-then-match
//! step so the staging handlers (and, ideally, the two base-scan call sites)
//! evaluate strict predicates identically.
