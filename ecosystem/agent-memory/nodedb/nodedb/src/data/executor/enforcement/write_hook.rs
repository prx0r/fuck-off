//! The one call every point / upsert write path makes to run its
//! image-folding enforcement.
//!
//! [`funnel::run_write_enforcement`] takes decoded documents. Every handler
//! that reaches it holds bytes instead, in one of two encodings that decode
//! differently and fail differently:
//!
//! * a **submitted** body is MessagePack for every storage mode (a strict
//!   collection encodes its Binary Tuple on the way to disk), and a body with
//!   no readable fields carries no column any binding can read — so it folds to
//!   nothing rather than failing the write;
//! * a **stored** body is whatever the collection actually persists, so it
//!   needs the collection's own format, and one that will not decode is
//!   corruption: treating an unreadable pre-image as "no pre-image" turns an
//!   UPDATE into an INSERT and credits a target with the row's whole new value
//!   on top of the contribution it already holds.
//!
//! Encoding the distinction in [`ImageBody`] is what keeps each handler from
//! re-deciding it, and keeps the "which of these is a hard error" answer in one
//! place instead of eight.
//!
//! # Nothing is decoded for a collection that declares nothing
//!
//! Folding a write's images means DECODING its stored pre-image, and a stored
//! body is only guaranteed to be a readable document for a collection that
//! declares what its columns mean. A caller that decodes unconditionally fails
//! every write to a constraint-free collection carrying an opaque body. So the
//! whole hook short-circuits on
//! [`EnforcementOptions::has_image_enforcement`](nodedb_physical::physical_plan::EnforcementOptions::has_image_enforcement).
