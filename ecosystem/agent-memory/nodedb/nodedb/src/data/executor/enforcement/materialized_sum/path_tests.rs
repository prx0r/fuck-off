//! `delta.rs` proves the arithmetic and `apply.rs` proves the write-back. What
//! neither can prove is that each PATH reaches them: a bulk update, a bulk

//! their rows differently, and a path that folds nothing leaves a stored total
//! that silently disagrees with the `SUM(...)` over the source rows. These tests
