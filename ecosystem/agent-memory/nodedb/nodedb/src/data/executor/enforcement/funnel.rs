//! The single entry point every write path calls to run its enforcement.
//!
//! # Why enforcement lives one level ABOVE `apply_point_put`
//!
//! The materialized-sum target write is itself an
//! [`apply_point_put`](crate::data::executor::core_loop::CoreLoop::apply_point_put).
//! If enforcement ran INSIDE `apply_point_put`, that derived write would re-enter
//! enforcement, and the only thing standing between it and unbounded recursion
//! would be a re-entrancy flag — a piece of mutable state that has to be set
//! before the inner call and cleared after it, on every path. There is no such
//! path discipline available here: every step in the write path is a `?`, and a
//! single early return between "set" and "clear" leaves the flag stuck, silently
//! disabling enforcement for every subsequent write on that core. That failure
//! is invisible; it looks exactly like a collection with no constraints.
//!
//! Keeping enforcement above `apply_point_put` removes the flag and the failure
//! mode with it. The derived target write calls `apply_point_put` directly, which
//! runs no enforcement, so it IS the recursion floor by construction rather than
//! by a runtime guard that can be left in the wrong state.
//!
//! No depth counter is needed either: a materialized sum whose target is itself
//! the source of another materialized sum (an A→B→C chain) is refused at DDL
//! time, so a target write can never produce another target write even in
//! principle.
//!
//! # The hash chain does NOT flow through here
//!
//! Hash chaining rewrites the row BODY — it wraps the document with a
//! `_chain_hash` field — so it must run BEFORE the body is encoded and stored,
//! and its output is the body `apply_point_put` receives. This funnel runs
//! against the images of a write that has already been encoded and applied, so
//! it is structurally the wrong place for a body rewrite. Hash chaining stays a
//! separate pre-write call on the paths that use it.
