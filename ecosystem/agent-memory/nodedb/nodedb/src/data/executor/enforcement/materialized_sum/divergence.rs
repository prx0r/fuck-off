//! The leader-side check that a plan's materialized-sum resolution still covers
//! the rows the write actually matched.
//!
//! A predicate-driven write (`BulkUpdate`, `BulkDelete`, `TRUNCATE`,
//! `UPDATE ... FROM`) carries a resolution the Control Plane derived from a
//! reconnaissance scan taken BEFORE execution. Between that scan and this apply,
//! a concurrent write can add a row with a join value the scan never saw, or
//! rewrite a matched row's join key. Folding such a row would address a target
//! the plan carries no surrogate for — and the fold's own
//! `MaterializedSumTargetNotFound` fires only once the statement is already
//! part-written, leaving a stored total that disagrees with the `SUM(...)` over
//! the source rows.
//!
//! So the leader re-derives the join-key set from the rows it matched and
//! answers `ErrorCode::OllpRetryRequired` BEFORE any write, exactly as the
//! surrogate-set and implicit-edge OLLP verifications in
//! [`crate::data::executor::handlers::bulk_dml`] do — same leader-only gate,
//! same "return without writing" contract, same retry code the coordinator
//! re-recons on. Followers accept the leader's decision: a follower whose redb
//! snapshot lags would re-derive a different set and poison an attempt that is
//! valid on the leader.
//!
//! # Coverage, not equality
//!
//! The surrogate-set check compares for EQUALITY because the predicted set IS
//! the set every replica applies to. This resolution is a lookup TABLE, not an
//! apply set: an entry the write turns out not to need costs one unused
//! surrogate, while an entry it needs and does not have is the wrong total. So
//! the guard is coverage — every join value the matched rows require must be
//! present — which fires on exactly the drift that corrupts a total and never on
//! drift that cannot.
//!
//! # Coverage is demanded only of the bindings THIS core applies
//!
//! A binding whose target does not share the source's vShard is applied by a
//! sibling `ApplyBalanceDelta` task, and the Control Plane records that by
//! REMOVING its join values from the resolution. Those values are missing on
//! purpose, so checking them would report a divergence every single time and
//! the coordinator would re-recon, resolve, remove them again, and resubmit
//! forever. They are covered instead by the settlement's own read-set entry,
//! which this core validates through the ordinary Calvin OCC path — same
//! "abort before any mutation" contract, on the images the shipped deltas were
//! actually folded from.
