//! The pre-/post-image pair a single write produces, plus the scope and

//!
//! Every write-path enforcement (materialized sums, hash chain, BALANCED)
//! needs to know not just *what* the row now contains but *how it got there*.
//! Passing a single document plus a separate "is this a delete" flag lets a
//! caller describe a mutation that cannot exist, and — worse — lets a caller
//! that only has the post-image describe an UPDATE as though it were an
//! INSERT. [`RowImages`] makes the shape of the mutation the type itself, so
//! that class of caller mistake stops compiling.

/// The variant IS the shape of the mutation. A caller holding only a
/// post-image physically cannot construct [`RowImages::Update`], because that
/// variant demands the pre-image too — which is what stops an update being
/// accounted as an insert. That was the concrete bug this type replaces: the
/// old API took one document and derived one positive delta from it, so a
/// materialized total only ever incremented, and a DELETE never subtracted at
/// all.
///
/// There is deliberately **no** `Move` variant. A write that changes a join
/// key is an [`RowImages::Update`] like any other; the materialized-sum fold
/// derives the two-target split itself from `old_doc[join] != new_doc[join]`,
/// where it has the binding in hand and the comparison means something.
/// Hoisting the move into this type would push it onto the hash chain and
/// BALANCED as well — neither of which knows what a join key is — forcing both
/// to carry a case that is meaningless to them.
///
/// Consumers match exhaustively with no `_ =>` arm. That is the point: adding
/// a fourth mutation shape makes the compiler name every enforcement that must
/// decide what it means, instead of letting a new shape fall silently into a
/// catch-all that treats it like the old ones.
