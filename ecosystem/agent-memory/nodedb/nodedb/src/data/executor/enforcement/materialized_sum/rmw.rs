//! The read-modify-write that moves one materialized-sum balance.
//!
//! One implementation, two callers, deliberately:
//!
//! * the **co-resident** path — [`super::apply`] — runs it inside the SOURCE
//!   write's transaction, because one core owns both rows;
//! * the **cross-shard** path — the `ApplyBalanceDelta` handler — runs it in a
//!   transaction of its own on the TARGET's core, because the source's
//!   transaction cannot reach rows this core does not own.
//!
//! Those are two different transactions, but they must produce byte-identical
//! rows: the balance the cross-shard task writes has to be the balance the
//! co-resident path would have written, or the same statement would total
//! differently depending on where two collections happened to hash. So the
//! arithmetic, the encoding decisions and the refusals all live here, and each
//! caller supplies only the transaction it owns.
//!
//! The write goes through [`CoreLoop::apply_point_put`], not a bare
//! `sparse.put`: the target row gets WAL-consistent transaction membership,
//! inverted-index maintenance, secondary and versioned index maintenance, column
//! statistics, document-cache population and aggregate-cache invalidation —
//! everything any other write of that row would get.
