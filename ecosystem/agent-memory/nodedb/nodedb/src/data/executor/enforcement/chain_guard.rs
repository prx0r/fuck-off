//! Advancing — and un-advancing — a collection's hash-chain head around one
//! INSERT.
//!
//! The chain rewrites the row BODY (it injects `_chain_hash`), so it must run
//! BEFORE the body is encoded and stored, which is why it is a pre-write call
//! and not part of the image-folding funnel. What makes it need a guard rather
//! than a function call is the head: it is mutated in memory before the write
//! is known to succeed, and persisted inside the write's own transaction. Every
//! path that abandons the write between those two points has to put the head
//! back, and there is exactly one correct pre-image to put back — the one
//! captured before the advance.
//!
//! Holding the capture in a value the caller carries is what makes "restore it"
//! a single call at each abort site instead of a rule each handler re-derives.
