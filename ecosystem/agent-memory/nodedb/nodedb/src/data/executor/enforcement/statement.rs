//! Settling the BALANCED entries a write produced against the boundary that
//! owns them.
//!
//! BALANCED is a boundary predicate, not a row predicate: debits and credits
//! arrive on different rows, so no single write can be judged on its own. The
//! boundary is a transaction — and an autocommit statement IS a transaction, so
//! a statement that writes one leg of a journal by itself is unbalanced by the
//! definition and is refused. That is the point of the constraint: a balanced
//! ledger cannot be populated one leg at a time.
//!
//! Which boundary a write belongs to is decided by
//! [`CoreLoop::balanced_txn_entries`]: with a transaction batch open the
//! entries accumulate onto it and the batch checks them once at commit; with
//! none open the statement is its own boundary and checks immediately, before
//! it commits, so a refusal writes nothing.
//!
//! # Why some callers pre-compute their entries here instead of collecting the
//! # funnel's
//!
//! A statement that commits ROW BY ROW (bulk delete, bulk update, truncate,
//! update-from-join, and a MERGE's delete arms) has already made row N durable
//! by the time row N+1 folds, so a check that ran after the last row could only
//! report a violation it can no longer undo. Those paths derive the statement's
//! entries from images they already hold and settle them BEFORE the first row
//! is written — the helpers below exist for exactly that, and they read nothing
//! at all for a collection that declares no BALANCED constraint.
