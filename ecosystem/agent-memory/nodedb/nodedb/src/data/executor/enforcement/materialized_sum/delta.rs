//! The pure fold from a write's row images to the signed balance deltas that
//! write owes each materialized-sum target.
//!
//! Deliberately free functions with no `CoreLoop`, no storage handle and no
//! transaction: everything here is arithmetic over two documents and a binding,
//! so the interesting cases — a DELETE subtracting, an UPDATE contributing only
//! its difference, an UPDATE that moves a row from one target to another — are
//! all testable without opening a database.
//!
//! The arithmetic itself lives in
//! [`binding_image_deltas`](crate::query::binding_image_deltas), which the
//! Control Plane calls too when it settles a CROSS-SHARD target's delta at plan
//! time. This module's job is to map the executor's [`RowImages`] onto that one
//! rule, so the two planes cannot total the same write differently.
//!
//! The defect this replaces derived ONE positive delta from ONE document. A
//! total maintained that way only ever grows: a DELETE never subtracted, an
//! UPDATE re-added the row's whole new value on top of its old contribution, and
//! a row whose join key changed kept crediting the target it had left.
