//! Array engine checkpoint flush for `CoreLoop`.
//!
//! ## What is at stake
//!
//! `ArrayStore::memtable` is a plain in-memory `Memtable` (see
//! `engine::array::memtable`). Every `INSERT INTO ARRAY` / `DELETE FROM ARRAY`
//! lands there and advances the core watermark
//! (`dispatch::array::mutate` calls `note_write_lsn` with the Control Plane's
//! `wal_lsn`), so the periodic checkpoint reported those writes as durable and
//! the manager truncated the `ArrayPut` / `ArrayDelete` records that were their
//! only copy. The memtable is drained to a segment only by an explicit
//! `NDARRAY_FLUSH` or by the `flush_cell_threshold` auto-flush — neither of
//! which is ordered against the truncation the checkpoint authorises. A restart
//! after truncation returned an array missing every cell written since the last
//! time a user happened to run `NDARRAY_FLUSH`.
//!
//! ## Why this reuses `ArrayEngine::flush` rather than writing a checkpoint blob
//!
//! Unlike KV / columnar / the sync gate, the array engine already has a real
//! durable form and a boot path that reads it:
//!
//! * `ArrayEngine::flush` drains the memtable into a compressed sparse segment,
//!   writes it with tmp+fsync+rename, installs it, and persists the per-array
//!   `manifest.ndam` — the manifest write being the commit point that makes the
//!   segment reachable.
//! * `ArrayStore::open` (reached from `ensure_array_open` on the first read after
//!   a restart, and from `ensure_array_open_for_replay` during WAL replay) loads
//!   that manifest and mmaps every segment it names.
//! * `ArrayStore::scan_tiles` and the bitemporal `scan_tiles_at` read segments
//!   and memtable together, so a restored segment answers a slice exactly as the
//!   memtable did before the flush.
//!
//! A checkpoint blob would therefore persist a second, redundant copy of state
//! the engine already knows how to write and read back — and a worse one: it
//! would bypass the tile compression, the per-tile MBR statistics the query
//! planner prunes on, and the compaction path that later merges those segments.
//! The bug was never a missing format; it was that the existing flush was
//! reachable only by an explicit user command. Calling it here is the fix.
//!
//! ## What LSN is durable after a flush
//!
//! Segments carry a `flush_lsn` and the manifest a `durable_lsn = max(flush_lsn)`
//! — "every WAL record at or below this is already in a segment". Stamping the
//! flush with the core watermark makes that claim true: this runs on the core's
//! own thread between tasks, and an array write reaches `note_write_lsn` (which
//! raises the watermark) only after `put_cells` / `delete_cells` has already
//! stamped the memtable, so every cell with `lsn <= watermark` is in the drain.
//!
//! An array whose memtable is empty flushes nothing and leaves its manifest's
//! `durable_lsn` where it stands. That is not a gap: an empty memtable means
//! every cell ever applied to this array is already in a segment, so the
//! watermark is durable for it either way. The stamp is left alone rather than
//! advanced with an empty write because doing so would rewrite every array's
//! manifest on every cycle to record a claim nothing reads back.
//!
//! ## Why the floor is the manifest, not `replay_floors.rs`
//!
//! Arrays flush independently of one another, so the "already durable through"
//! watermark is per-array and already recorded: it is the `durable_lsn` this
//! flush stamps into each array's manifest. `replay_array_wal` skips every
//! record at or below it.
//!
//! Re-applying such a record would usually be merely redundant — the writes are
//! absolute and keyed by `(tile, coord)` with `system_from_ms` taken from the
//! WAL payload, so it writes the identical version back. It is not redundant
//! after a bitemporal audit purge: the purge physically removes a superseded
//! tile-version from the flushed segment, and a still-retained `ArrayPut` below
//! the watermark would re-materialise exactly the version the purge erased.
