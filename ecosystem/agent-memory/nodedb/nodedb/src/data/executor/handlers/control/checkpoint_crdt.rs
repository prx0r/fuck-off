    /// manifest write. That single write is the commit point: a collection the

    /// collection's file from outliving it and reloading at every subsequent
    /// boot.

    ///
    /// A `TenantCrdtEngine` is a set of in-memory `LoroDoc`s with no store
    /// behind them. `load_crdt_checkpoints` reads these files back at boot and
    /// WAL replay re-imports the deltas above them; there is no third source.
    /// So a flush that failed while the core still reported its watermark would
    /// authorise deleting the delta records that are the only remaining copy of
    /// the state this flush did not write — the documents come back at whatever
    /// version the last SUCCESSFUL checkpoint captured, with every edit since
    /// silently gone and no error at read time to show for it.
    ///
    /// Any tenant that cannot be exported or published returns `Err`, and the
    /// caller clamps the reported checkpoint LSN to the last LSN the CRDT
    /// engines were known durable through.
    ///
    /// Stamping with the core watermark mirrors `checkpoint_kv_engines`: this
    /// runs on the core's own thread between tasks, and a delta apply raises the
    /// watermark only after the `LoroDoc` has already imported it.
