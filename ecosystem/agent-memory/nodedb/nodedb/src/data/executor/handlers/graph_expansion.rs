//! Graph expansion for cross-engine fusion, in the surrogate domain.
//!
//! Fusion legs meet on identity, and every engine's identity is the global
//! `Surrogate`. The expansion therefore runs surrogate-in / surrogate-out:
//! vector and FTS hits seed it directly, and the walk itself never touches the
//! node-name table. Names are resolved exactly once, at the end, over the
//! reached set — the rows that can actually appear in a response — instead of
//! once per visited node and once per traversed edge.
//!
//! A query that names its own seed node (`... GRAPH SEED 'alice'`) enters
//! through [`GraphSeeds::Names`], which resolves those names to surrogates once
//! and then joins the same path.
