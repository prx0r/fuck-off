//! Data Plane enforcement of the row-level-security WRITE policy.
//!
//! The Control Plane compiles a collection's write policy into the plan's
//! `rls_write_check` slot. For a write whose row image is produced where it is
//! persisted — an update's post-image, a delete's pre-image, an upsert's merged
//! body — that image does not exist at plan time, so the predicate travels with
//! the plan and is decided here, against the bytes actually about to be written.
//!
//! Two rules this module exists to hold:
//!
//! - **A rejected row fails the statement.** Skipping it would report a write
//!   that never happened, and leave the remaining rows of a multi-row statement
//!   applied — a partial write the caller cannot see or undo.
//! - **An empty check admits everything.** Empty means "no write policy
//!   restricts this identity here" (or superuser), the same convention the read
//!   filters use, so an ungoverned collection pays nothing.
//!
//! Distinct from [`super::rls_eval`], which decides the READ policy: that one
//! bounds which rows a `RETURNING` clause may show, this one bounds which rows
//! may be written at all.
