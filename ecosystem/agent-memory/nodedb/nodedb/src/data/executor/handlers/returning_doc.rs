//! Construction of the JSON document a DML `RETURNING` projection reads.
//!
//! Every `RETURNING` path — point and bulk UPDATE/DELETE, `UPDATE ... FROM`,
//! MERGE, CRDT document DML — builds its rows from a stored row body, and two
//! invariants are shared by all of them:
//!
//! - **The body must be decoded with the collection's storage mode.** A strict
//!   collection stores Binary Tuples. The MessagePack decoder does not reject
//!   one: it reads the tuple's leading byte as a scalar and *succeeds*, yielding
//!   a document with every real column missing. A storage-mode-blind decode
//!   therefore ships plausible-looking garbage to the client instead of failing.
//! - **The storage key becomes `id` only when the body carries no `id`.** A
//!   collection with a declared `id` primary key is authoritative for its own
//!   key; overwriting it with the surrogate hex storage key returns a value the
//!   client never wrote and cannot use to address the row.
