//! Recursive re-partitioning for the grace-hash join spiller.
//!
//! When [`super::grace_spill::PartitionedSpiller::finish_and_probe`] finds that
//! one spilled partition's BUILD side is larger than `per_partition_budget`,
//! materializing it whole (the old behavior) would re-introduce the very OOM the
//! spiller exists to prevent: under heavy join-key skew one partition can hold
//! most of the build side. Instead, that partition is RE-PARTITIONED — its
//! spill file is read back STREAMING (frame-by-frame, one row resident at a
//! time, never the whole file) and re-hashed with a FRESH seed into `SUB_P`
//! sub-partitions, each written straight to a new spill file. The probe side is
//! re-partitioned with the SAME seed so matching rows co-locate. The sub-
//! partitions are then processed recursively.
//!
//! Distinct keys spread across the sub-partitions on each re-seed, so a skewed-
//! but-diverse build side shrinks geometrically until every sub-partition fits.
//! IDENTICAL-key skew (every row the same join key) is unsplittable at any seed:
//! all rows always collide into one sub-partition. That case is bounded by a
//! depth cap in `grace_spill` which returns a deterministic
//! [`crate::Error::MemoryExhausted`] — never an OOM, never a panic.
//!
//! ## Streaming, not whole-file
//!
//! The re-partition read uses [`FrameStreamReader`], which mirrors the document
//! external-sort [`super::super::document::sort::RunReader`] pattern: io_uring
//! streaming via [`UringSeqReader`] on Linux, a `std::io::BufReader` fallback
//! when io_uring is unavailable. Peak read memory is one refill buffer plus one
//! row — NOT the partition. A truncated/corrupt frame on re-read is a HARD error
//! (mirrors `RunReader::next_row`), never a silent row drop.
//!
//! ## Spill framing
//!
//! Spill files use [`super::spill::SpillPartitionWriter`]'s framing:
//! `[u32 LE len][len bytes]` per row, with NO leading count header (unlike the
//! sort run format). [`FrameStreamReader::next_row`] therefore reads until a
//! clean EOF on the frame boundary rather than counting down a header.
