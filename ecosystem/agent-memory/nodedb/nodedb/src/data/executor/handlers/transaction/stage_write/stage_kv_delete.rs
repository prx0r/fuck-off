//! Statement-time staging for the KV `Delete`.
//!
//! Split out of `stage_kv.rs` to keep that file under the per-file line
//! budget, the same way `stage_kv_atomic.rs` / `stage_kv_transfer.rs` /
//! `stage_kv_ttl.rs` were.
//!
//! A staged delete does two things a staged put does not: it resolves the
//! surrogate of the row it is tombstoning (from the overlay's own doc-id
//! binding when this transaction already staged the row, otherwise from the
//! base engine's key→surrogate map, so the tombstone lands on the same row the
//! COMMIT-time replay will remove), and it decides that row against the
//! compiled RLS write predicate. The row being removed is the only image a
//! delete has, and it is resolved under BASE ∪ OVERLAY so a row this
//! transaction already changed is judged as it now stands rather than as it was
//! before the transaction began.
