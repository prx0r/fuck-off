//! Its own file because it obeys a different transaction rule to the
//! UPDATE/INSERT arms it follows. Those share one redb write transaction and
//! are all-or-nothing across the whole set; each DELETE arm instead takes its
//! own transaction and commits on its own, which is what lets the arm's
//! post-commit bookkeeping (affected count, RETURNING pre-image, redo
//! write-set entry, delete event) observe a removal that is already durable.
//! Keeping the two phases in separate files stops a later edit from folding a
//! delete into the put phase's transaction, which would change when each
