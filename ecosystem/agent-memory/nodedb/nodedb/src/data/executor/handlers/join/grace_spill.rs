//! Streaming partition-spiller for the grace-hash join.
//!
//! Where [`super::grace_partitioner::grace_join_in_memory`] takes OWNED Vecs of
//! every row (whole build + probe side in RAM at once), this module bounds
//! memory: rows are fed ONE AT A TIME via [`PartitionedSpiller::push_build`] /
//! [`PartitionedSpiller::push_probe`], and the moment a partition's in-memory
//! buffer exceeds `per_partition_budget` it is drained to a
//! [`SpillPartitionWriter`] on disk. From that point the partition's rows live
//! on NVMe, never in RAM, so the full build/probe side is NEVER all resident.
//!
//! `finish_and_probe` processes each partition through a work queue, holding ONE
//! partition resident at a time — so its size bound is the FULL per-query
//! materialization budget (`materialize_cap`), NOT the push-time
//! `per_partition_budget` spill threshold. A partition whose build side FITS
//! `materialize_cap` is materialized (streamed back from its spill file, or taken
//! from RAM), indexed via [`HashIndex`], and probed. A partition whose build side
//! EXCEEDS `materialize_cap` (join-key skew) is
//! RE-PARTITIONED instead of materialized: its spill file is stream-read frame-
//! by-frame and re-hashed with a fresh seed into sub-partitions (see
//! [`super::grace_repartition`]), which are processed recursively. A genuinely
//! unsplittable partition (identical-key skew) hits a depth cap and returns a
//! deterministic [`crate::Error::MemoryExhausted`] — it NEVER materializes an
//! oversized partition, so the spill path can never OOM. Results are unioned and
//! the GLOBAL `limit` is applied ONCE at the end — identical to the in-memory
//! reference.
//!
//! ## Why partitioning is correct
//!
//! Identical reasoning to `grace_partitioner`: [`partition_hash`] hashes the
//! SAME extracted key value bytes that [`HashIndex`] memcmp-matches on, with a
//! fixed seed, so any pair that *could* match co-locates in one partition.
//! Cross / keyless joins are cartesian products and run as a single partition.
//!
//! ## Why the doc id is dropped
//!
//! Join output is produced by `merge_join_docs_binary`, which only ever reads
//! the VALUE bytes of each side — the `String` id is never emitted. Storing
//! `(String::new(), value)` therefore loses nothing and avoids framing the id
//! through every spill file.
//!
//! ## Platform fallback
//!
//! Spilling requires io_uring ([`SpillPartitionWriter::create`] returns `None`
//! off-Linux or when uring is unavailable). When `create` returns `None` the
//! partition simply stays in memory: correctness is preserved, only the
//! memory bound is lost. This is a platform capability gap, not an error.
