//! Statement-time staging for `ColumnarOp::Insert`.
//!
//! A columnar batch INSERT issued inside a `BEGIN..COMMIT` block is staged
//! here, one overlay `Put` per row, so a later same-transaction columnar
//! SELECT observes the newly inserted rows (read-your-own-writes) before
//! COMMIT. COMMIT durable replay is unchanged: the buffered `ColumnarOp::Insert`
//! plan is still replayed through `execute_columnar_insert` inside the
//! COMMIT `TransactionBatch`, which remains the sole durable apply.
//!
//! Row identity: a columnar row has no separate primary document id — it is
//! surrogate-identified. The overlay's doc-id side-map therefore uses
//! `surrogate_to_doc_id` (hex), matching the identity `execute_columnar_scan`
//! uses for its own rows (`scan_memtable_rows_with_surrogates`).
//!
//! Row body encoding: each row's schema-ordered `Vec<Value>` is wrapped as a
//! `Value::Array` and encoded via `nodedb_types::value_to_msgpack` — decoded
//! the same way by `merge_overlay_into_columnar_scan`. This is a
//! staging-only representation; it plays no part in the durable segment
//! format written at COMMIT by `execute_columnar_insert`.
//!
//! ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE: the staged body is the MERGED row, not the submitted
//! one. The overlay exists to show what this transaction has written, and after
//! a conflict merge that is the stored row with the assignments applied —
//! exactly what `execute_columnar_insert` persists at COMMIT. Staging the
//! submitted body instead made the overlay and the eventual durable state
//! disagree, so a same-transaction `SELECT` showed a row the COMMIT would never
//! produce. The merge is resolved against this transaction's own overlay first
//! and the engine second, so an earlier statement's staged row is the one it
//! merges against.
//!
//! Row-level security: the write policy decides the batch here, at the
//! statement, not only at COMMIT — otherwise a refused row would be reported as
//! affected and be readable by this transaction until COMMIT failed. A plain
//! insert's rows were already decided at plan time (the plan carries them), so
//! this gate bites for the ON CONFLICT shape. It decides the same merged image
//! that is staged, so the gate and the overlay can never disagree.
//!
//! Field coercion mirrors `execute_columnar_insert` exactly (same
//! `ndb_field_to_value` / bitemporal column population) via the shared
//! `columnar_write::schema` helpers, so a staged row's values match what the
//! durable COMMIT replay will eventually store.
