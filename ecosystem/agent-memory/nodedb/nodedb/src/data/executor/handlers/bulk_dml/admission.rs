//! Everything a bulk predicate write verifies BEFORE it writes anything, and
//! the apply set it settles on.
//!
//! Three predictions travel on a bulk plan, all derived by the Control Plane
//! from a scan taken before execution: the matched surrogate set, the implicit
//! edges of the matched documents, and the materialized-sum target resolution.
//! Each is verified the same way — recompute the actual value on the group
//! LEADER, and answer [`ErrorCode::OllpRetryRequired`] without writing on
//! divergence — and each has the same reason for being leader-only: a follower
//! whose redb snapshot lags the leader's prediction window would compute a
//! different answer, poison the attempt, and exhaust the retry budget on a
//! dataset nobody is touching.
//!
//! They live here rather than duplicated in the update and delete handlers
//! because a check that exists in one and not the other is a hole in exactly one
//! statement shape — and because a fourth prediction should have one place to be
//! added.
