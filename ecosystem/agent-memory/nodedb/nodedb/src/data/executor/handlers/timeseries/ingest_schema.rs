    /// Schema for a collection's very first memtable.
    ///
    /// A collection created through DDL declares its columns and its
    /// `TIME_KEY`; that declaration is the schema, so the time key keeps its
    /// name and position and every declared column exists from the first row
    /// on. Only a collection with no declaration — raw ILP protocol ingest
    /// into a measurement that was never created — falls back to inferring a
    /// shape from the batch itself.
    ///
    /// That fallback is lossy in more ways than the one usually noticed, so it
    /// must stay reachable ONLY for genuinely undeclared measurements. Against
    /// a declared collection it silently substitutes:
    ///
    /// - **the time key's NAME** — `infer_schema` hard-names it `timestamp`, so
    ///   a collection declaring `ts TIMESTAMP TIME_KEY` stores the value
    ///   correctly and projects NULL under `ts`. This is the visible symptom
    ///   and the only one a column-by-column comparison catches.
    /// - **column ORDER** — inferred order is time key, then tags, then fields
    ///   in first-seen order, discarding any declared interleaving.
    /// - **column TYPES** — inference maps string fields to `Symbol`, ints to
    ///   `Int64`, and both floats and bools to `Float64`. A declared
    ///   `TIMESTAMP` column carrying a numeric field becomes `Int64`, and a
    ///   `BOOL` collapses to `Float64`. Same class as the columnar engine's
    ///   `Geometry`-degraded-to-`String`, which `load_columnar_schema_seed`
    ///   exists to prevent.
    /// - **bitemporal column POSITIONS** — the reserved columns are appended to
    ///   an inferred base rather than sitting where the declaration put them.
    ///
    /// A collection whose declaration happens to match what inference produces
    /// — string tags, float fields, time key first — looks correct afterwards,
    /// which is why a break here can go unnoticed for a long time.
