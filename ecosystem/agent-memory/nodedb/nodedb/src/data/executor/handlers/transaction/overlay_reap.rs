//! Deterministic lease GC for per-transaction staging overlays.
//!
//! Each in-flight transaction stages its not-yet-durable writes into three
//! per-`TxnId` maps on `CoreLoop` (`txn_overlays`, `graph_txn_overlays`,
//! `txn_created_columnar_engines`). They are normally released by
//! `MetaOp::DropTxnOverlay`, emitted by COMMIT/ROLLBACK. The teardown hooks
//! (pgwire `on_connection_end` → reclaim, native `run()` reclaim) drop the
//! overlay best-effort — they log and continue if the dispatch fails. This
//! module is the backstop for the residue: overlays orphaned when a client
//! vanishes, a teardown dispatch fails, or a vShard leader moves mid-txn.
//!
//! Every staged write and every in-transaction read-your-own-write refreshes
//! the overlay's `last_touch` stamp (see `TxnOverlay::touch`), so a still-live
//! transaction — even a long read-only one — always carries a fresh stamp.
//! [`CoreLoop::reap_expired_overlays`] reclaims only overlays whose stamp has
//! aged past [`OVERLAY_LEASE_NS`]. It runs synchronously from the maintenance
//! tick, between reactor tasks — never interleaved with a COMMIT's
//! `MetaOp::ResolveTxn` (which reads the overlay to build the RedoRecord),
//! because the core is single-threaded per shard.

/// Conservative logical-nanosecond lease after which an untouched per-txn
/// staging overlay is treated as abandoned and reclaimed.
///
/// INVARIANT: this MUST exceed the maximum legitimate live-idle window of an
/// open transaction. If it did not, a still-active txn's overlay could be
/// reaped while single-shard COMMIT (`MetaOp::ResolveTxn`) still needs to read
/// it to build the RedoRecord for vector/FTS index durability — corrupting a
/// live transaction. The governing bound is the session idle timeout (auth
/// config `idle_timeout_secs`, default 3600s = 1h; `session_absolute_timeout_secs`
/// caps total session life when set): a vanished client's connection is torn
/// down at that timeout, firing the best-effort overlay drop, and this reaper
/// only backstops the case where that teardown dispatch itself failed. Six
/// hours sits comfortably above the default 1h idle timeout with generous
/// margin. Biasing LONG is deliberate — a too-long lease only delays
/// reclaiming dead overlays, a too-short lease corrupts live ones.
///
/// Deriving this from the auth config (`>= 2 * max(idle_timeout, absolute_timeout)`)
/// is the follow-up once that config is threaded onto the Data-Plane core; it
/// is a Control-Plane `auth` config today and is not reachable from here.
