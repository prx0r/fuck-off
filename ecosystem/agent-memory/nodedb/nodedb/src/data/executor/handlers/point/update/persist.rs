//! Landing the post-update image, with its secondary indexes and everything the
//! collection's constraints derive from it, in one write.
//!
//! Separate from image construction because the concern here is atomicity, not
//! value: which of three mutually exclusive write shapes the collection takes,
//! and what has to travel with the body so no index is left describing the old
//! value. A bitemporal collection appends a version and diffs the VERSIONED
//! index; a plain collection with index paths diffs the secondary btree; a
//! collection with neither writes the body alone. Keeping the three side by
//! side in one file is what makes it visible that only the last one is allowed
//! to skip the diff, and that a body whose index diff cannot be computed must
//! fail rather than write alone.
//!
//! All three run inside ONE transaction this function owns, and image-folding
//! enforcement runs inside that same transaction before it commits. That is why
//! the enforcement lives here rather than in the caller that sequences the
//! statement: a materialized-sum target write is a document write of its own,
//! and running it after this function returned would put it in a SECOND
//! transaction — a crash between the two leaves the row updated and the total
//! it feeds stale, which is exactly the divergence the constraint exists to
//! rule out.
