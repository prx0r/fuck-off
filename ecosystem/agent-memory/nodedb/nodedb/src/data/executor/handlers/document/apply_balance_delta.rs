//! `ApplyBalanceDelta`: move one materialized-sum balance on a TARGET row whose
//! collection does not share the source write's vShard.
//!
//! A collection homes to one vShard, so a binding's source and target are
//! generally served by different cores. The co-resident path applies the balance
//! inside the source write's own transaction, which is only possible because one
//! core owns both rows. When it does not, the Control Plane settles the delta at
//! plan time and appends this op as a task of its own, homed on the target — the
//! same shape an implicit graph edge takes, and for the same reason. The pair
//! then classifies as multi-shard and commits atomically through Calvin.
//!
//! # This is a full document write
//!
//! The read-modify-write is [`CoreLoop::apply_balance_delta`], shared with the
//! co-resident path: same arithmetic, same encoding decisions, same refusals. A
//! balance must not depend on where two collections happened to hash.
//!
//! # Durability names the TARGET
//!
//! The response's write-set entry carries `collection: Some(target)` and the
//! row's ABSOLUTE post-image. The post-apply redo re-derives the vShard from
//! that name, so the durable record homes with the row it describes rather than
//! with the statement that caused it. An absolute image, never the delta: a redo
//! record replays through `apply_point_put`, and replaying a delta would add it a
//! second time.
