//! The sync-gated apply path: a peer delta arriving with provenance.
//!
//! Every exit answers a sender that is holding the write open, so each one has
//! to name a [`GateDisposition`] — apply, retry, or compensate. Which one it is
//! decides two things together, and they must never disagree:
//!
//! * the client-visible frame the Control Plane builds, and
//! * whether the producer high-water-mark advances.
//!
//! A retryable refusal holds the mark so the re-push at the same seq is
//! admitted rather than deduplicated to `Duplicate`; a terminal one advances it
//! so a dead frame cannot wedge the stream. Deriving both from one value is
//! what keeps them consistent — a refusal that reported "retry" to the sender
//! while advancing the mark, or held the mark while telling the sender to give
//! up, loses the write either way.
