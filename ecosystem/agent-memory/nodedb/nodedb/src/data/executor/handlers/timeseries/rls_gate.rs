//! Row-level-security WRITE enforcement for timeseries ingest.
//!
//! A timeseries row only exists once the line-protocol parser has produced it,
//! so the Control Plane ships the compiled predicate on the plan and the rows
//! are decided here. Every ingest format — line protocol from the raw listener,
//! its canonical MessagePack form, JSON rows — normalizes into parsed ILP lines
//! before anything is appended, so deciding them here covers all of them.
//!
//! The whole batch is decided before the first row is appended: a rejection
//! fails the statement with nothing written, rather than leaving the lines
//! ahead of the offending one durable.
