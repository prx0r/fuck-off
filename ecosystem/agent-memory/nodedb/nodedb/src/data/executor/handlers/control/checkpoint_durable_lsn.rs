//! Per-engine durable-LSN contributors for the coordinated checkpoint.
//!
//! One method per engine whose state is memory-only with the WAL as its ONLY
//! other durable copy. Each flushes its engine and answers the single question
//! `execute_checkpoint` folds into the LSN it reports:
//!
//! > what is the highest LSN whose effects on this engine are recoverable
//! > WITHOUT the WAL?
//!
//! They share one shape, and it is the shape the data-loss bug came from
//! violating. On success the engine's `*_durable_lsn` advances to the flushed
//! point and that point is returned. On FAILURE the error is surfaced — logged
//! at `warn` naming the clamp it caused, never swallowed — and the LAST-KNOWN
//! durable LSN is returned instead of the watermark. The reported LSN authorises
//! `WalManager::truncate_before` to unlink segments below it, so a flush that
//! failed must never widen that authority over the very state it failed to
//! write. Clamping costs WAL growth until the next cycle succeeds; not clamping
//! costs the data.
//!
//! Every engine whose flush can fail now has a contributor here. The one engine
//! with state on this core and NO contributor is full-text search, and it needs
//! none: `InvertedIndex` is not flushed at all, because it is not memory-only.
//! Both of its write paths (`index_document`, `index_document_in_txn`) write
//! POSTINGS / DOC_LENGTHS / DOC_TERMS / STATS straight into the same redb `Database` the
//! `sparse` engine commits to — bypassing the LSM memtable precisely so the
//! index is atomic with the document write. redb commits durably, so an FTS
//! write at or below the watermark is already on stable storage in a store that
//! is not the WAL. There is nothing to flush and therefore nothing to clamp.
