//! Materialization of applied CRDT deltas into the sparse document store.
//!
//! When a CRDT (Loro) delta is applied — whether from a sync peer or a native
//! client — the merged document must also be written into the sparse DOCUMENTS
//! store so `DocumentScan` / `ShapeSnapshot` observe it, exactly as a native
//! schemaless put does. These helpers are split out of `crdt.rs` to keep that
//! file within the file-size limit; they extend `CoreLoop` with the encode +
//! write steps invoked from `execute_crdt_apply`.
//!
//! Materialization reuses the same `apply_point_put` transaction helper the
//! native put path uses, so a synced document gets identical side effects:
//! column statistics, aggregate-cache invalidation, document cache, secondary
//! indexes, spatial R-tree, and vector index maintenance — plus a Data → Event
//! Plane `WriteEvent` (tagged with the task's `CrdtSync` source, so CDC/change
//! streams observe it while AFTER triggers do not cascade). The one deliberate
//! exclusion is inverted BM25 text indexing: the sync stream delivers that via
//! a separate `FtsIndexDoc` frame, so `index_text` is `false` here to avoid
//! double-indexing the same surrogate.
//!
//! Write-path enforcement is deliberately NOT run here either. Materialization
//! calls `apply_point_put` directly, one level BELOW the enforcement funnel, so
//! no materialized-sum delta is folded for a synced row. A delta is a RELATIVE
//! change to a target row's total, and these deltas already passed admission on
//! the ORIGIN replica — where the write was issued, its constraints decided, and
//! its target row credited. Folding again as the merged row lands on each
//! receiving replica would add the same amount once per replica.
