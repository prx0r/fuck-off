//! FTS LSM level compaction, budget-gated against the per-database
//! maintenance CPU tracker.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Each FTS index uses a tiered LSM: memtable flushes produce L0 segments.
//! When a level accumulates more segments than `max_segments_per_level`
//! (default 8), all segments at that level are merged into one at the next
//! level. Without periodic compaction the L0 count grows without bound,
//! increasing per-query merge cost.
//!
//! ## Budget enforcement
//!
//! Each `(tenant, collection)` is gated against the per-database maintenance
//! CPU budget before compaction work starts. Collections whose database has
//! exhausted its budget for the current minute are deferred and counted in
//! `CompactionStats::fts_deferred`. On the next maintenance cycle the budget
//! window slides and the deferred collections are eligible again.
//!
//! ## Crash safety
//!
//! The merged segment is written and the source segments removed in a single
//! redb write transaction via `InvertedIndex::compact_commit`. A crash
//! mid-compaction leaves the original segments intact; the next maintenance
//! pass detects the same compaction need and retries.
//!
//! ## Failure surfacing
//!
//! Three distinct failure modes are surfaced via `CompactionStats` so
//! operators can distinguish work-done from work-deferred without parsing logs:
//!
//! - `fts_deferred` increments per collection whose lease was rejected by
//!   the budget gate, *or* whose merge aborted on backend / commit failure.
//!   In both cases the original segments are intact and the next maintenance
//!   pass will retry.
//! - `fts_enumeration_failed` is set when the segments-table read txn itself
//!   fails — we couldn't even discover what work was needed.
