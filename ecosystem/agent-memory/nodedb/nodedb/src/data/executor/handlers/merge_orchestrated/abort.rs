//! Unwinding a partially-applied MERGE.
//!
//! Separate from the forward apply because reversal is governed by a different
//! rule: the forward path may fail anywhere, but the unwind has to put back
//! exactly the state that lives OUTSIDE the redb write transaction — the HNSW
//! and R-tree deltas and the read-through document cache — since dropping the
//! transaction already reverses everything inside it. Collecting that in one
//! place is what keeps every abort site in the apply pass identical, and makes
//! "did we reverse all of it?" a question about one short file.
