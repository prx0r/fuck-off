//! Fold a transaction's staging overlay into a base scan result, or into a
//! base secondary-index lookup's doc-ID list, so an in-transaction SCAN or
//! `WHERE indexed_field = value` observes the transaction's own uncommitted
//! point writes (read-your-own-writes).
//!
//! The base scan only reads durable rows. This step layers the per-transaction
//! overlay on top: a staged tombstone hides its base row, a staged put replaces
//! the base body (and is re-checked against the scan predicate, since an update
//! may have moved the row out of the result), and a staged put for a surrogate
//! absent from the base set is appended when it satisfies the predicate. The
//! `seen` set keeps additions from duplicating rows already present.
//!
//! The secondary-index lookup path needs the same shape of fix but a
//! different mechanism: the `INDEXES` table is never staged (only body
//! storage is), so `merge_overlay_into_index_lookup` decodes each candidate's
//! staged body and re-extracts the indexed field via the same
//! `extract_index_values` the write path uses, rather than re-checking a
//! generic predicate closure directly on the indexed term. It additionally
//! re-checks any compound-predicate residual (the WHERE conjuncts beyond the
//! indexed field) via the same schema-aware `ScanFilter` evaluator the base
//! scan overlay merge uses, so a staged row can't satisfy the indexed term
//! alone and skip the rest of the WHERE clause.
//!
//! Current-version only: temporal (`AS OF` / valid-at) scans never call this,
//! because staged bodies represent the current version alone. Staged put bodies
//! are encoded identically to base-stored bodies (same canonicalization /
//! Binary Tuple form), so the caller's decode + scan predicate + projection
//! apply to them unchanged.
