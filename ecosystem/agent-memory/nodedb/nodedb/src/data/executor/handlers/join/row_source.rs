//! Uniform row-source abstraction for join sides.
//!
//! A [`RowSource`] represents one side of a join and allows the grace-hash-join
//! driver to consume rows through a single `for_each` call instead of inline
//! `scan_collection_for_each` calls scattered through `drive_grace_build`.
//!
//! Two variants exist:
//! - [`RowSource::LocalScan`] — a pure pass-through wrapper around
//!   `CoreLoop::scan_collection_for_each` that is byte-identical to the previous
//!   inline calls (the local-join path).
//! - [`RowSource::ShuffleStream`] — rows staged to a LOCAL scratch file by a
//!   cross-node shuffle (the "receive-to-spill, then local grace join" design).
//!   The file holds `[u32 LE len][row-bytes]` frames, ONE join row per frame,
//!   each frame's bytes being the SAME per-row msgpack shape `scan_collection_for_each`
//!   yields — so the grace build/probe closures are byte-identical regardless of
//!   which source feeds them.
//!
//! The `match self` inside [`RowSource::for_each`] is the single dispatch seam:
//! the grace driver in `grace_drive.rs` is parameterized over `RowSource` values
//! and never branches on the variant itself.
