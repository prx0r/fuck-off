//! Data Plane write-policy gate for KV rows.
//!
//! Every KV write whose image is produced where it is persisted — the merged
//! body of an `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, the row a `DELETE` removes, the row a
//! TTL mutation leaves untouched, a field merge, an atomic's computed value,
//! both sides of a transfer — funnels through here so the policy is decided
//! against the exact bytes about to be written.
//!
//! Two properties this indirection exists to hold:
//!
//! - **One decode rule for the whole engine.** KV never stores Binary Tuples,
//!   so the stored body is always MessagePack and the shared gate is always
//!   called with no strict schema. Spelling that out once stops a caller from
//!   guessing.
//! - **An opaque scalar fails closed.** A single-column `value` write stores a
//!   bare scalar with no field for the predicate to name, so the shared gate
//!   rejects it — the same evaluation that decides a field-addressed row, not a
//!   carve-out.

use crate::data::executor::handlers::rls_write_gate;

/// Decide one KV row body against the compiled write policy.
///
/// `rls_write_check` empty means no write policy restricts this identity here,
/// and the row is admitted without decoding anything.
