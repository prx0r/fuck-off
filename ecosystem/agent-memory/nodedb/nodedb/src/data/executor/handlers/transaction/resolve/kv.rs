//! KV serializer for transaction resolve.
//!
//! Turns the KV post-images a transaction staged into its overlay into the
//! engine-native WAL sub-record shapes the KV replay path decodes — the SAME
//! shapes the autocommit KV WAL path produces, so producer and replay share one
//! encoding:
//!
//! * A staged value ([`Staged::Put`]) → `RecordType::Put`, `encode_kv_put`'s
//!   `("kv_put", collection, key, value, ttl_ms, expire_at_ms, surrogate)`. The
//!   overlay holds the resolved ABSOLUTE post-image (an atomic
//!   `Incr`/`Cas`/`GetSet` stages its computed value, never a delta), so resolve
//!   emits exactly that. When the overlay carries an absolute expiry
//!   ([`StagedTtl::ExpireAt`]) for the slot it travels verbatim so replay
//!   installs the exact instant instead of recomputing `now + ttl`; a `Persist`
//!   (or no TTL delta) emits `None`.
//! * A staged tombstone ([`Staged::Tombstone`]) → `RecordType::Delete`,
//!   `("kv_delete", collection, [key])`.
//!
//! ## `ttl_ms` in the redo payload
//!
//! The overlay stores only the resolved ABSOLUTE expiry instant, never the
//! original relative `ttl_ms`. Replay installs the absolute instant when the
//! record carries one and ignores the relative `ttl_ms`, so that slot is
//! vestigial in a redo sub-record and is set to `0` in every case.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! The overlay keys slots by surrogate in a `HashMap`, so entries are collected
//! into a `BTreeMap` keyed by the overlay doc-id (lowercase-hex of the KV key)
//! before emitting. Two replicas resolving the same transaction produce
//! byte-identical redo ops.
