//! Stateless PUT admission: the checks a write must pass before it is written.
//!
//! Separate from the write itself because these are the only steps in the put
//! that are allowed to REFUSE a row, and none of them may leave a trace when
//! they do. They read the collection's declared rules and the pre-image, decide
//! yes or no, and touch nothing — which is what makes it safe to run them
//! inside a transaction the caller owns and will commit. Keeping them out of
//! the write path means a new rule is added here, where "no side effects" is
//! the file's stated contract, rather than somewhere a later reader has to
//! prove it.
