//! Statement-time row-level-security enforcement for the columnar family's
//! staged writes.
//!
//! Staging is where an in-transaction statement's row image is produced and
//! made visible, so it is where the write policy has to decide it — the same
//! rule the document and key-value staging paths follow. COMMIT replay gates
//! the durable apply as well, and that stays: this is defence in depth, not a
//! replacement. What it adds is that a statement whose image the policy refuses
//! fails AT THE STATEMENT rather than reporting `{"affected": N}` and exposing
//! the refused row to the transaction's own reads until COMMIT fails.
//!
//! Every helper here decides the WHOLE set before the caller mutates any
//! overlay, so a refusal leaves the overlay exactly as it was.
