//! Vector (HNSW) index checkpoint write + load operations for `CoreLoop`.
//!
//! ## On-disk layout
//!
//! ```text
//! {data_dir}/vector-ckpt/core-{core_id}/
//!     MANIFEST                        # names the live generation
//!     gen-{n}/{db}:{tid}:{coll}.ckpt  # one file per live index
//! ```
//!
//! The per-core directory is required because `data_dir` is shared across cores
//! and each core only owns the collections routed to its vShards; it also means
//! the loader needs no core-ownership filter on the filename.
//!
//! ## Why a generation + manifest
//!
//! An index emptied by deletes has nothing to write, and a dropped one is not in
//! the map at all. Under a FLAT directory both cases left the previous cycle's
//! populated file as the newest thing on disk while the flush still reported the
//! core watermark — authorising truncation of the very delete records that would
//! have re-emptied it. The result was resurrection: acknowledged deletes undone
//! by a restart, with nothing left in the WAL to redo them.
//!
//! Writing every live index into a fresh `gen-{n}/` and publishing the set with
//! ONE atomic manifest write removes that by construction. The manifest is the
//! only thing that makes a generation reachable, so "no file for this index"
//! restores as "no vectors" instead of as last cycle's contents, and a torn or
//! abandoned write is inert garbage rather than a half-published state.
//!
//! ## Why no replay floor
//!
//! Vector WAL records are idempotent against a restored index — `VectorOp::Insert`
//! upserts by surrogate and a delete of an absent vector is a no-op — so replay
//! above and below the generation's stamp both reproduce the same index. The
//! stamp is carried anyway, because it is what a failed flush clamps WAL
//! truncation to after a restart.
