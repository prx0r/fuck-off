//! Rebuilding the geometry R-tree entries of a restored columnar collection from
//! its restored rows.
//!
//! ## Why the checkpoint cannot leave this to the spatial checkpoint
//!
//! A `Geometry` column on a columnar collection is indexed as a live side-effect
//! of the insert: `execute_columnar_insert` calls
//! `index_columnar_geometry_columns`, which populates `CoreLoop::spatial_indexes`
//! and `spatial_doc_map`. Those two maps have their own checkpoint
//! (`spatial_checkpoint/`), and before the columnar replay floor existed they
//! also had a second, unconditional source: full WAL replay re-ran every insert
//! and therefore re-ran the indexing.
//!
//! Installing a columnar floor removes that second source. The floor suppresses
//! exactly the insert records whose geometry entries the R-tree would otherwise
//! be rebuilt from, which would leave the R-tree dependent on the spatial
//! checkpoint alone — and that checkpoint reports no LSN and logs its write
//! failures rather than propagating them. A spatial flush that failed in the
//! same cycle this one succeeded would then silently lose the R-tree entries for
//! every gated row, with the rows themselves still present: spatial predicates
//! would stop matching rows that a full scan still returns.
//!
//! Rebuilding here removes the cross-engine dependency instead of ranking the
//! two checkpoints against each other. The R-tree is a derived index over rows
//! this generation already restored, so it is reconstructible from them and does
//! not belong in the checkpoint file. It is idempotent: the shared indexing
//! helper removes a document's existing entries before inserting — the same
//! property that lets WAL redo of a document collection's `Put`s (via
//! `apply_point_put_spatial`) safely re-index document geometry over whatever a
//! restored spatial checkpoint already holds.
//!
//! ## What this rebuild can and cannot see
//!
//! The live insert path indexes each row under the `id` field of the PAYLOAD it
//! was handed. This rebuild reads the row back from the engine, so it can only
//! offer the columns the SCHEMA declares — the entries agree exactly when `id`
//! is a declared string column, which is the case for a collection whose DDL
//! declares it.
//!
//! A row whose `id` reached the insert path as an undeclared payload field is
//! not indexed here — and cannot be: an undeclared field is never written into
//! the segment or the memtable, so no restore path could recover it. Such a row
//! is equally invisible to any read of the restored rows, not just to this one;
//! the identity was already lost at write time, and this rebuild neither creates
//! nor widens that gap.
