    /// ## Why the core watermark is an exact stamp here
    ///
    /// This runs on the core's own thread between tasks, and every columnar
    /// record that mutates an engine raises the watermark AFTER applying:
    /// `execute_columnar_insert` calls `note_collection_write_lsn`, and so —
    /// since the fix that accompanies this checkpoint — do
    /// `execute_columnar_update` and `execute_columnar_delete`. So every
    /// columnar record with `lsn <= watermark` is already folded into the
    /// engines exported here, and every record above it is not.
    ///
    /// That property is load-bearing in a way it is not for KV. KV tolerates a
    /// record being replayed over a generation stamped below it, because its
    /// unstamped records (index DDL) replay idempotently. Columnar has no such
    /// slack: `ColumnarOp::Update` is delete-old-PK + insert-new-row, so a
    /// record applied before the export and replayed again after it duplicates
    /// the row. An applied-but-unstamped columnar record is therefore silent
    /// corruption, which is why update/delete must note their LSN rather than
    /// this stamp being defensively lowered.
    ///
    /// A record whose live execution affected ZERO rows notes no LSN and so may
    /// fall above the stamp and replay. That is safe and stays safe: it matched
    /// nothing against the state that the export captured, so re-executing the
    /// same predicate against that same restored state matches nothing again.
