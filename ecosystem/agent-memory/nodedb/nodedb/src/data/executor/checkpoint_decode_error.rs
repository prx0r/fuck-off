//! Why a published checkpoint generation could not be decoded.
//!
//! One type across every engine's load path because they all answer the same
//! question the same way: a generation decodes WHOLE or not at all, and the
//! reason must name the specific corruption it found. A boot-time restore that
//! reports "the generation is bad" without saying which file, which value, and
//! what was expected leaves an operator staring at a full WAL replay with no way
//! to tell a truncated write from a format skew from a hand-edited data dir.
