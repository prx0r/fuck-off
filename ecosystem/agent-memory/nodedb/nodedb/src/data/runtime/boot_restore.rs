/// `seed_catalog_state`: a checkpoint restores state as of the LSN it was
/// stamped with, and replay then resumes strictly ABOVE that LSN. Loading after
/// replay would overwrite newer replayed state with the older checkpoint's rows;
/// loading after the seed would leave the seed's empty columnar engine in place
/// and silently discard the restored rows.

    // nothing, and re-appended every retained record on top of the
    // partition that already held it. A timeseries ingest is an append,
    // so nothing masked the duplicate rows. A committed `partition.meta`
    // that will not decode is fail-stop: it is corruption of state this
    // core is about to claim is durable, and skipping it quietly would
    // under-restore the collection while leaving its records un-gated. An
    // UNCOMMITTED partition directory (no `partition.meta` at all — the
    // remains of an interrupted flush) is still a legitimate, silent skip.
