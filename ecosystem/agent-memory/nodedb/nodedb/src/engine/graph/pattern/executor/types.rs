///    free-ranged over all local nodes.  A free-ranging anchor must NOT
///    emit because every shard covers all its own local nodes during its
///    own pass; emitting would duplicate work and flood the frontier with
///    every zero-degree local sink.
/// 2. The node has **zero raw adjacency** in the triple's direction
///    (regardless of edge-label filter).
/// 3. The caller supplied a locality predicate (`is_remote_node`).
/// 4. The predicate returns `true` for the node's name.
///
/// A node that has edges in the direction but none that pass the label
/// filter produces an empty local result and is NOT included in the

/// Passing `None` for the predicate (the default for fully-local,

/// - `source_row` — the bindings present at that triple's source (so the
///   resumed rows re-bind `a`/`b`/the edge var identically to a single pass).
/// - `frontier` — the surviving un-expanded frontier entries, each a
///   `(node_name, path_string)` pair (reached at `depth - 1`, awaiting
///   expansion AT `depth`). The path string is the accumulated path-so-far
///   from the original source when the edge variable is bound (`want_path`),
///   empty otherwise. Carrying it verbatim is what keeps resumed `RETURN p`
///   path strings continuous with the first pass. Keying the frontier by node
///   NAME (not a CSR-local dense id) is what makes a resume safe to broadcast
///   to ALL cores on a node: a local id is per-core and overlaps across cores,
///   so a foreign core would misinterpret it against its own CSR; a name is
///   global, so only the owning core resolves it to a local id and every other
///   core naturally skips names it does not own.
/// - `depth` — the hop depth at which `frontier` is resumed.
///
/// There is deliberately **no `visited` set**: termination relies on the
/// varlen `min..max` depth bound plus downstream coordinator row-dedup.
/// Carrying `visited` across a future wire boundary is explicitly rejected,
/// so the executor never depends on it for correctness — a node re-reached
/// on resume produces a duplicate row that the coordinator collapses, never
/// a skipped or mis-depthed row.
//
// The fields are produced by the executor on a capped expansion and consumed by
// the cross-plane resume dispatch (`GraphOp::MatchVarLenResume`). The struct is
// wire-serializable (serde + zerompk) so the cursor can ride the SPSC bridge
// inside the resume plan variant; each `frontier` entry is a `(node_name,
// path_string)` pair carrying a global node name alongside its accumulated
// path-so-far. Name-keying makes the cursor core-agnostic: the resume plan is
// fanned to all cores, and each core resolves the name against its own CSR —
// the owning core resumes, foreign cores skip names they do not own.
