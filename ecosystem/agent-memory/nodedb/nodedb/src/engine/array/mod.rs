//! NodeDB Array Engine — LSM-style storage on top of `nodedb-array` segments.
//!
//! Lives in the Data Plane: `!Send`, no tokio. Persistence routes through
//! the [`wal::ArrayWalAppender`] trait, which Origin wires to the real
//! group-committed WAL writer. Recovery replays WAL records past the
//! last `ArrayFlush` watermark; flushed segments are durable on disk and
//! mmap'd by the segment store on open.
