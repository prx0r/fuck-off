//! TenantCrdtEngine core: the struct, its tenant-wide constraint lookup view,
//! construction, and per-collection state access.
//!
//! Each `(tenant, collection)` owns its own `LoroDoc` (one [`CrdtState`] per
//! collection). The validator, dead-letter queue and the cross-engine array
//! surrogate registry stay tenant-wide because UNIQUE / FK constraints are
//! cross-collection (and FK referents may be array-engine rows).
//!
//! Behaviour lives in sibling modules: `apply` (delta apply), `snapshot_io`
//! (snapshot export/import), `constraints` (constraint installation and
//! fencing), and `rows` (row reads, history, purge).
