//! Partition merge executor.
//!
//! Merges multiple sealed partitions into one, combining their columnar
//! data and unifying symbol dictionaries. Used by the background merge job.
//!
//! Crash safety protocol:
//! 1. Write merged partition to new directory
//! 2. Single manifest transaction: insert merged, mark sources Deleted
//! 3. Background cleanup: physically remove source directories
//!
//! If crash at step 1: partial output cleaned on recovery (no manifest entry).
//! If crash at step 2: redb transaction is atomic.
//! If crash at step 3: manifest says Deleted, recovery cleans orphans.
