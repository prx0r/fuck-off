//! Data-group Raft recovery gate.
//!
//! Writes to replicable collections are made durable as `ReplicatedEntry`
//! records in their data group's Raft log, and the engine state they produce
//! (KV hash index, columnar/timeseries/spatial in-memory state, graph node
//! labels, …) is rebuilt only by re-applying that log into the Data Plane.
//!
//! Raft's `commit_index` / `last_applied` are volatile: after a restart every
//! locally hosted group must win its own randomized election before it commits
//! a no-op and carries its retained log forward to the applier. Those elections
//! run independently of the metadata group's, so waiting only on metadata
//! readiness lets the gateway open while a data group has replayed nothing — an
//! acknowledged write then reads back as if it never happened, with no error to
//! explain it.
//!
//! This gate closes that window: startup is held until every locally hosted
//! data group has elected a leader, committed through the end of its retained
//! log, and applied that log. It fails closed — a timeout aborts startup rather
//! than opening a gateway that would serve incomplete state.
