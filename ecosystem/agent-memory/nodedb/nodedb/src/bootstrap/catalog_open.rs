//! Catalog handle for boot steps that only read.
//!
//! redb commits its allocator state when a read-write `Database` drops, so a
//! boot step holding a read-write handle rewrites `system.redb` even when it
//! only read from it. These steps take [`ReadOnlySystemCatalog`] instead, and
//! fall back to a read-write open only when redb reports the file needs
//! repair — repairing has to write, and refusing to boot would be worse.
