//! Per-loop consumer side of the shutdown watch.
//!
//! Held by every background loop. Expected usage pattern:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! loop {
//!     tokio::select! {
//!         _ = shutdown.wait_cancelled() => break,
//!         _ = tick.tick() => { /* work */ }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `wait_cancelled` is cancel-safe — dropping the future in a
//! `select!` losing arm does not miss a subsequent signal
//! because the underlying `watch::Receiver::changed` is itself
//! cancel-safe and the state is re-checked on every poll.
