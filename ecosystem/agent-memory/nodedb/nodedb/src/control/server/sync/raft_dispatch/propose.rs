//! Raft proposal for sync writes.
//!
//! In a multi-node deployment the `async_raft_proposer` field is set on
//! `SharedState` after Raft starts. When it is `Some` **and** the write plan
//! maps to a `ReplicatedEntry`, the write is proposed to the Raft group and
//! blocks here until the entry is committed to a quorum and applied on the
//! local node. That gives quorum-durable ACK semantics: an acknowledged sync
//! write cannot be lost on leader failover.
//!
//! The idempotency gate embedded in every `ReplicatedEntry` runs on every
//! replica via the replicated provenance, so a reconnecting Lite client that
//! re-sends a delta on failover will be deduplicated on the new leader.
//!
//! Single-node deployments never set `async_raft_proposer`, so they always fall
//! through to the local Data Plane path — zero overhead.
