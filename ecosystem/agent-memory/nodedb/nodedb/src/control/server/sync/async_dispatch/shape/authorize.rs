//! Read authorization for shape subscriptions.
//!
//! A `ShapeDefinition` is client-supplied and names the collection the server
//! will snapshot, so a shape is a read request wearing a subscription's shape.
//! It carries the same requirements as every other read: an identity
//! established by the handshake, and a read grant on the named collection.
//! This is the read-path counterpart of `authorize_delta_write`.
