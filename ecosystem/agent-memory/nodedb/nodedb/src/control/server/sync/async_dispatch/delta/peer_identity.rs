//! Hold each Loro peer id to one producer, before its delta reaches the merge.
//!
//! Downstream of the merge there is nothing left to decide with: a delta whose
//! `(peer, counter)` range the document already covers is trimmed away, and
//! that is indistinguishable from an honest replay no matter how carefully the
//! apply reports it. Two replicas sharing a peer id therefore lose writes with
//! every counter green.
//!
//! Here the two *are* distinguishable, because the server knows which durable
//! producer each session belongs to. A peer id is claimed by the first producer
//! to use it in a collection and refused to any other — so the collision is
//! answered with a rejection the client can act on instead of a discarded write
//! it never hears about.
