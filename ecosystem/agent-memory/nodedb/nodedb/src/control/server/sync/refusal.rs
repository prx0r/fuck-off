//! Whether a failed sync dispatch is retryable or terminal.
//!
//! Every engine ack path faces the same question and must answer it the same
//! way: the sender retires its durable entry on a terminal refusal and re-sends
//! on a retryable one, so getting this backwards either loses the write or
//! spins forever re-sending one that will never land.
//!
//! The judgment lives here, in one place, for the same reason the CRDT delta
//! path routes all three of its outcomes through a single function: the bug
//! both guard against came from deciding terminality per-channel, letting two
//! paths disagree about the same error. A shared classifier cannot disagree
//! with itself.
