//! Classification of a Data-Plane failure into "the write was refused and
//! nothing was applied" versus "the write may in fact have landed".
//!
//! The write funnel appends a write's redo record BEFORE the Data Plane decides
//! whether to accept it, so a refusal always arrives with the record already in
//! the log. Left alone, restart replay re-applies it and a write the server told
//! the client it refused comes back. The cure is a `WriteAborted` marker naming
//! the forward record's LSN — but emitting one for a failure whose write
//! actually landed is strictly worse than the bug: recovery would then DELETE
//! committed data.
//!
//! So the predicate below is deliberately one-directional. A code earns an abort
//! only when the code itself is proof that nothing was installed. Anything whose
//! outcome is ambiguous — the shard state is unknown, the failure could have
//! occurred part way through apply, or the code is an opaque catch-all — keeps
//! the current behaviour and replays. That is the safe side of the trade: a
//! refused write that survives a restart is a bug, a committed write erased by
//! recovery is data loss.
//!
//! The match is exhaustive on purpose. A new [`ErrorCode`] must be classified by
//! whoever adds it, not silently inherit either answer.
//!
//! [`abort_refused_write`] is the one place that acts on that verdict, and the
//! write funnel is its only caller — every `AppendHere` write in every engine,
//! including the Raft apply loop, passes through there.
