//! Enforcement for the durable-at-ack barrier in [`super::submit_write`].
//!
//! The barrier only has something to wait on when a durable LSN exists, and a
//! write-class plan reaching it with no LSN is NOT by itself a bug: most
//! engines have write ops whose durability is owned somewhere other than this
//! funnel's WAL append, and those arms are deliberate and documented. A naive
//! "write-class plan with no LSN" assertion would fire on every document
//! INSERT (the row is redb-synchronous-durable) and be switched off within a
//! day, which is strictly worse than no check.
//!
//! What IS an invariant is narrower and checkable: for the engines below,
//! EVERY write-class op mints a WAL redo record on this path. If one of them
//! reaches the acknowledgement with nothing to wait on, a write op was filed
//! under a "no durable record" arm and the acknowledgement is a lie — exactly
//! the failure class that only shows up as data loss after a `kill -9`.
//!
//! The counter mirrors [`crate::bridge::admission_chokepoint`]: debug builds
//! trip loudly, release builds keep counting so a regression stays observable
//! after the assertion is compiled out.
