//! Variable-length truncation resume queue for the cross-shard MATCH
//! coordinator.
//!
//! When a shard's variable-length expansion hits a hard cap it emits a
//! [`VarLenResume`] cursor instead of silently truncating. This module owns the
//! Control-Plane-side queue of those cursors: each cursor is routed back to the
//! node that owns its surviving frontier so a `MatchVarLenResume` plan can be
//! re-dispatched there to drain the remaining matches. The cursor type itself is
//! a nodedb-crate type (`VarLenResume`), so it lives here in the Control Plane
//! rather than in `nodedb-cluster`'s frontier-continuation coordinator.

/// Keys on the anchor bindings (`source_row`), the frontier node identities, the
/// triple index, and the hop depth — deliberately EXCLUDING each frontier
/// entry's accumulating `path_so_far`, which grows one node longer every round
/// and would otherwise make every re-emission look unique and defeat dedup.
///
/// Two resumes sharing a key re-expand the same frontier at the same depth from
/// the same anchor and therefore reach the same onward bindings, so the
/// coordinator dispatches only the first. This is what makes cross-boundary
/// continuation converge: a boundary node's cursor is visited-less by contract
/// (cross-round dedup is the coordinator's job), so without this key a
/// visited-less resume re-derives the same boundaries every round and the
/// pending queue fans out without bound. Bounds total resume dispatches to
/// `sources x nodes x hops`. Self-advancing cap-truncation resumes carry a
/// distinct advanced frontier/depth each round, so they hash differently and are
/// never wrongly collapsed.
