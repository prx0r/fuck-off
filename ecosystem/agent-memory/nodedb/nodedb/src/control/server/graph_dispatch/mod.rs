//! Cross-core BFS and shortest-path orchestration for graph traversal.
//!
//! In single-node mode, BFS is local: the Control Plane broadcasts
//! `GraphNeighbors` to all Data Plane cores hop by hop and collects results.
//!
//! In cluster mode, each hop partitions the incoming frontier by owning
//! vShard (resolved against live Raft leadership) BEFORE expansion: the
//! locally-owned subset expands on local cores, and each remote-owned subset
//! is shipped as a typed `NeighborsMulti` plan to its owning node via the
//! gateway's `dispatch_route` primitive. Local and remote `{src,label,node}`
//! responses decode identically and are merged before the next depth level
//! begins. See `hop::execute_neighbor_hop`.
//!
//! `GRAPH PATH` (`shortest_path`) still uses the post-expansion
//! `control::scatter_gather::coordinate_cross_shard_hop` scatter path; the
//! per-frontier owner-targeted expansion above is specific to the BFS /
//! subgraph traversal read path.
