/// Same two stages as the HTTP bearer route: the JWKS registry verifies the

/// `None` means "not authenticated", for every reason, including a deployment

/// assertion must be refused, never downgraded to an anonymous or trust
/// identity. The reason stays server-side so a caller cannot probe which
/// providers exist or why a token was refused.
