//! WAL append helpers for FTS and Spatial sync ingest paths.
//!
//! Each helper accepts a prebuilt payload struct, serializes it, and appends
//! to the WAL via `WalManager`.  The CP allocates the LSN here; the gate runs
//! Data-Plane-side at the apply handler.
//!
//! Callers are responsible for constructing the payload (which bundles
//! provenance + all operation fields) before calling these helpers.
