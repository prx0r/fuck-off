//! `gather_all_cores` fans a child plan to every Data-Plane core in parallel
//! using `join_all`, collects per-core payloads, and merges them into two
//! complementary views:
//!
//! - `raw`: concatenated per-core payloads (multiple msgpack arrays back-to-back).
//!   Consumed by the sync layer and legacy raw-scan paths.
//! - `merged_array`: a single msgpack array containing every row element
//!   from all cores.  Consumed by the response path and by `ProviderScan`
//!   embedding in join inputs.
//!
//! `finalize_aggregate` runs the Arrow SIMD post-processing pass for
//! `Gather{as_aggregate: true}` plans.
