/// One base collection's read observation from a distributed read whose result

/// Emitted by BOTH the GATHER path (`resolve::exchange` — one capture per base
/// collection under a root `Exchange{Gather}`, including both sides of a
/// gathered `HashJoin`) and the SHUFFLE path (`resolve::shuffle` /
/// `resolve::shuffle_aggregate` — one per join side). Each carries that
/// collection's own bare full-collection scan plan and the REAL per-collection
/// read-version LSN the gather/producers observed. The record seam re-derives
/// the collection / engine / read key from `scan_plan` (a single-collection
/// scan, so it is NOT collapsed to just the left side the way a `HashJoin` plan
/// is) and stamps the entry at `read_version_lsn`, so the commit-time OCC
/// validator re-homes and revalidates each collection's vshard independently.
/// This closes the serializability hole where a build-side (or non-left)
/// collection never appeared in the read-set and a concurrent write to it went
/// undetected.
