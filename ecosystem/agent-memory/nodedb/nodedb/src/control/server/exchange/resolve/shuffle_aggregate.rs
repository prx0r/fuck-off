//! Coordinator-side distributed shuffle-AGGREGATE orchestration (E5c).
//!
//! Resolves a root `Exchange{ShuffleAggregate}` wrapping a `QueryOp::Aggregate`
//! into a real cross-node distributed GROUP BY by tying together the already-built
//! producer (`PartialAggregateState`) and consumer (`ShuffleAggregateConsume`)
//! primitives:
//!
//! 1. Allocate a `shuffle_id` and a partition plan (`part -> owner node`).
//! 2. Encode the bare per-shard partial-aggregate producer plan as `plan_bytes`.
//! 3. Fan a `ShuffleProduceRequest` to every producer node of the source
//!    collection CONCURRENTLY (single side `side=0`, hash-partitioned on the
//!    GROUP BY columns). Each producer scans locally, computes per-group partial
//!    `GroupState`s, hash-partitions them on the group key to the part-owners,
//!    and streams them. Fail-fast: any producer error aborts the whole shuffle.
//! 4. After ALL producers succeed, fan a `ShuffleAggregateConsumeRequest` to
//!    every part-owner CONCURRENTLY. Each owner waits for its one staged side to
//!    finalize, merges the staged partial states, finalizes / HAVING-filters,
//!    and replies with its rows. Fail-fast on any consumer error.
//! 5. Concatenate every consumer's msgpack-array rows, apply the aggregate's
//!    GLOBAL result cap ONCE over the union (matching the single-node Gather
//!    path), and return it as a `Resolved::Gathered` response. Groups are disjoint
//!    across parts (a group key hashes to exactly one part) and HAVING is
//!    per-group, so a plain concat is the correct finalize. Eligibility forbids a
//!    global ORDER BY (per-part finalize can't honour a cross-part sort), so the
//!    cap is order-free — the same arbitrary-but-bounded semantics Gather has with
//!    no ORDER BY. Consumers receive NO per-part cap (that would silently drop
//!    rows per part); the cap is applied only here.
//!
//! # Plane discipline
//!
//! This runs on the coordinator's Control Plane (Tokio). The QUIC `send_rpc`
//! calls are Control-Plane I/O, which is allowed here. No storage I/O, no
//! io_uring, no Data-Plane access from this module.
