//! RAII in-flight guard for pgwire statement execution.
//!
//! Constructed at the top of a query handler and dropped when the statement
//! finishes (including early return, error, or panic-unwind). On construction
//! it bumps the connection's in-flight counter; on drop it decrements it and
//! stamps last-activity to "now". The listener watchdog reads that state to
//! decide idle eligibility, so this guard is what guarantees a long-running
//! statement is never idle-killed and that the idle window only starts once a
//! statement has actually completed.
