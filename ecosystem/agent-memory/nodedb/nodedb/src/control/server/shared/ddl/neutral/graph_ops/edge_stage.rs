//! In-transaction staging for graph-edge writes issued through the
//! `GRAPH ... EDGE` DSL.
//!
//! The `GRAPH INSERT EDGE` / `GRAPH DELETE EDGE` handlers dispatch a single
//! `GraphOp::EdgePut` / `EdgeDelete` directly to the Data Plane in autocommit.
//! Inside an explicit `BEGIN..COMMIT` block that direct dispatch would apply
//! the write DURABLY at statement time, so an in-transaction `MATCH` / `GRAPH
//! NEIGHBORS` would not observe it as staged (breaking read-your-own-writes)
//! and a ROLLBACK could not undo it. These helpers instead route the write
//! through the protocol-neutral staging gate
//! ([`route_in_tx_write`](crate::control::server::shared::session::staging_gate::route_in_tx_write)),
//! exactly like every other in-transaction point write: the Data Plane stages
//! the edge into the per-transaction `GraphTxnOverlay` (merged by Neighbors /
//! Hop for RYOW), the plan is buffered for COMMIT's durable replay, and
//! ROLLBACK drops the overlay.
//!
//! A SINGLE-HOME edge (both endpoints on one vShard, or single-node) stages
//! once into `vsrc`. A cross-shard (dual-home) edge is reachable from BOTH
//! endpoints, and each core merges only its OWN overlay on a read, so
//! [`stage_edge_dual_home`] stages the same edge into both the `vsrc` and `vdst`
//! overlays — read-your-own-writes works from either endpoint, and the touched
//! vShard set records both homes so ROLLBACK tears down both.
