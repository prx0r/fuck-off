//! Protocol-neutral in-transaction write-routing gate.
//!
//! Decides, for a single physical task submitted while a connection is
//! inside an explicit transaction block, whether the task is a plain read
//! (falls through to normal dispatch), a write that gets buffered for
//! COMMIT-time replay ("OK" now, durable apply later), or a stageable write
//! that must be applied to the per-transaction overlay immediately (real
//! command tag + statement-time constraint errors now, still buffered for
//! COMMIT's durable replay).
//!
//! This is the shared seam every protocol's dispatch loop routes through
//! (pgwire SQL today; native and the DSL/UPSERT path in later units), so the
//! staging decision lives in exactly one place. No pgwire types are
//! referenced here — callers translate the neutral [`InTxnRoute`] outcome
//! into their own protocol's response type.
