//! Protocol-neutral, LSN-versioned transaction read-set capture.
//!
//! Every read a transaction performs is recorded here as one or more
//! [`ReadSetEntry`]s, keyed by the same `(database_id, tenant_id, collection,
//! key)` namespace writes use so that read keys and write keys compare
//! directly. Capture is transport-agnostic: native (the canonical client),
//! pgwire, native direct-ops, and single-node multi-core fan reads all funnel
//! through [`record_read_set`], so no transport silently drops the read-set.
//!
//! A point read that HIT records [`ReadKey::Point`] carrying the row's
//! [`KeyRepr`]; an absent DOCUMENT point read records [`ReadKey::Predicate`]
//! (its placeholder surrogate would never collide with the phantom insert's
//! fresh surrogate), while an absent KV point read keeps its precise `Point`
//! key (the byte key any future write reuses). A
//! scan / search / aggregate records [`ReadKey::Predicate`] (collection scope
//! — the day-one phantom-safe floor). A multi-shard read records one entry per
//! participating shard, each stamped with that shard's own watermark LSN.
//! Absent-key / empty-result reads are recorded too: a "not found" is a
//! validatable phantom observation, not a no-op.
//!
//! No validation happens here — the entries are captured for the commit-time
//! optimistic-concurrency check to consume.
