//! The write-admission gate.
//!
//! Every write-class `PhysicalPlan` — regardless of transport or path — passes
//! through [`admit`] before it is enqueued to a Data-Plane core. The gate
//! decides one of four outcomes per write:
//!
//! - [`WriteAdmission::FastPath`] — an uncontended POINT write whose exact
//!   deterministic lock keys were acquired here. It carries a RAII
//!   [`WriteAdmissionGuard`] the caller holds across the enqueue + response; the
//!   guard releases the keys on drop. This is the normal autocommit path.
//! - [`WriteAdmission::FastPathBlocking`] — a single-node POINT write for a
//!   vShard with no Calvin scheduler. There is no lock table to fence against,
//!   so the caller awaits a FIFO-fair per-key async order-lock before the WAL
//!   append + enqueue, serializing concurrent same-key writes in arrival order.
//! - [`WriteAdmission::RouteToCalvin`] — a point write whose keys are currently
//!   held by a pending commit (acquire returned `Blocked`), OR any predicate /
//!   bulk / multi-home write. The caller submits it through the deterministic
//!   scheduler, which queues it FIFO behind the holder and applies it in order.
//! - [`WriteAdmission::ExemptRead`] — a non-write (read / meta op), or a
//!   Calvin-scheduled apply that already holds its locks.
//!
//! The fence holds because the fast path and the scheduler share the SAME
//! `Arc<Mutex<LockManager>>` (via [`SharedState::calvin_lock_managers`]): a
//! commit's lock validation calls `acquire` on the same key, is `Blocked`, and
//! waits; whoever takes the OS mutex first wins, with no time-of-check /
//! time-of-use gap.
