//! Protocol-neutral statement setup: plan, authorize, extract implicit edges,
//! resolve materialized-sum targets, authorize again, and admit the descriptor
//! leases — as ONE retried unit.
//!
//! Planning reads the catalog and records a descriptor version; the lease that
//! pins that version is only acquired afterwards. A descriptor drain that starts
//! between those two steps fails the acquisition, so both must live inside the
//! same retry budget or the drain surfaces to the client as a hard error. The
//! acquisition fails closed before any lease is granted, so a retried attempt
//! never re-reads data it was not entitled to.
//!
//! Every step here is safe to re-run: planning is pure, the edge-bearing catalog
//! flag is a read-then-conditional-write, endpoint surrogates resolve
//! get-or-create against a stable key, and a failed admission rolls its own
//! refcounts back before returning.
