//! The authorization step for hand-built physical plans in this tree.
//!
//! The SQL-function handlers here bypass the planner: they take a collection
//! name out of the caller's own arguments, construct a [`PhysicalPlan`] by
//! hand, and hand it to `dispatch_utils::dispatch_to_data_plane`, which accepts
//! a trusted internal plan and therefore runs neither the RBAC check nor RLS
//! injection. Everything the planner-driven read path applies between planning
//! and dispatch has to be applied here too, and applied identically, or the
//! function reads arbitrary rows under the caller's own SQL.
//!
//! [`CollectionReadGate`] is that step in one place: the RBAC check, the RLS
//! predicate merged into the hand-built plan, and the redaction inputs for
//! whatever the handler returns. A handler resolves its collection, opens a
//! gate on it, injects into every plan it builds, and redacts (or refuses) on
//! the way out.
//!
//! # Inject, do not refuse
//!
//! A plan that carries a `filters` / `rls_filters` slot can express the policy,
//! so [`CollectionReadGate::inject_rls`] puts it there and the query keeps
//! working with fewer rows. [`CollectionReadGate::refuse_if_read_policy`] is
//! for the plans that carry no such slot at all (`EstimateCount`): those cannot
//! express a row filter, so a policy on the collection makes the answer
//! unrepresentable rather than smaller, and they fail closed.
//!
//! A hand-built WRITE has no separate gate here at all. Its verdict — admit the
//! image, ship the compiled predicate for the Data Plane to decide, or refuse —
//! belongs to the injection pass alone, so a handler that builds the same plan
//! variant a planned statement builds cannot reach a different one.
