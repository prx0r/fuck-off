//! Declared system-initiated Data-Plane work.
//!
//! The Data Plane is reachable two ways: with a capability minted by
//! authorizing a user's request (`AuthorizedTask`), or as work the server
//! started itself, where there is no user and therefore nothing to authorize —
//! retention enforcement, backup and restore, cluster snapshot transfer, DDL
//! apply, catalog maintenance.
//!
//! Nothing in an argument list distinguishes those two cases, which is how a
//! client-reachable read once reached storage through the system door with no
//! identity behind it and no row-level security applied. [`SystemTask`] makes
//! the second case something a caller has to state: constructing one requires
//! naming the [`SystemReason`] that explains why no identity exists. A
//! client-reachable path cannot name one truthfully, so it has to go through
//! authorization instead.
