//! Snapshot phase for `MOVE TENANT`.
//!
//! Dispatches `PhysicalPlan::Meta(MetaOp::CreateTenantSnapshot)` to the
//! local Data Plane and returns the raw snapshot bytes.  In the offline v1
//! implementation the snapshot is performed on the local node only — the
//! offline drain window ensures no cross-node writes are in-flight.  The
//! cluster fan-out orchestrator (`backup::orchestrator::backup_tenant`) is
//! intentionally bypassed here because its caller path requires
//! `Arc<SharedState>`, which the DDL dispatch pipeline does not carry.
