/// Where one sorted index's Data Plane state lives.
///
/// A sorted index is an order-statistic tree built from, and maintained by, the
/// rows of the collection it covers. Both of those happen inside the `KvEngine`
/// of a single Data Plane core, which owns nothing but the vShards routed to it:
/// the backfill can only see rows on its own core, and `KvEngine::put` /
/// `delete` can only update index trees registered on its own core. So the
/// index has exactly one correct home — the vShard the *collection* hashes to,
/// in the caller's database, which is where every KV write to that collection
/// already lands.
///
/// Registration, maintenance, query and teardown must therefore all resolve the
/// same coordinates from the same place. This type is that place: it carries the
/// owning collection (resolved from the index registry — see [`super::gate`])
/// rather than the index name, so no route can derive a different vShard or a
/// different `database_id` than the rows do.
