//! Leader-aware forwarding for in-transaction staging control ops.
//!
//! The per-transaction staging overlay lives on the Data-Plane core that owns
//! the target vShard — i.e. on that vShard's current Raft leader. When this
//! node is NOT the leader for a vShard a transaction stages a write to, the
//! `MetaOp::StageWrite` (and, at COMMIT / ROLLBACK, the `MetaOp::DropTxnOverlay`)
//! must execute on the leader, keyed purely by `txn_id` — the Data-Plane
//! handlers are session-less, so a wire-carried `txn_id` is all the leader needs
//! to stage into / drop the correct overlay.
//!
//! INVARIANT: for a given vShard, the stage, every read-your-own-writes read,
//! and the overlay drop all resolve to the SAME node (the vShard's leader at the
//! time each runs). A leader change mid-transaction strands the staged overlay
//! on the former leader — the same failure surface Calvin already tolerates for
//! staged cross-shard state. A stranded overlay is bounded (one transaction's
//! staging), invisible (its `txn_id` comes from a monotonic counter and is never
//! reused or committed), and observable (the `active_txn_overlays` gauge plus the
//! ERROR the commit/rollback teardown logs when a drop-forward fails); a former
//! leader that crashes clears it with its memory. There is no automatic
//! time-based reclaim of a still-running former leader's stranded overlay today —
//! it is cleared on that node's next restart.
//!
//! Both choke points (`staging_gate::stage_write`, `commit::drop_txn_overlay`)
//! resolve the leader themselves and keep their existing LOCAL dispatch
//! byte-identical; only the REMOTE arm routes through [`forward_to_leader`],
//! which fails CLOSED — a `LeaderUnknown` resolution surfaces as
//! `Error::NotLeader` via the gateway dispatcher. `commit::drop_txn_overlay`'s
//! remote arm wraps this in a bounded retry (`retry_not_leader`) so a
//! transient leader election does not strand the overlay after a single
//! attempt; `staging_gate::stage_write`'s remote arm surfaces the error
//! directly to the statement layer. Neither ever falls back to local staging
//! on a non-leader.
