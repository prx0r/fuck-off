//! Data-Plane response payload decoding for the RESP surface.
//!
//! Data-Plane responses are MessagePack (`response_codec`), not JSON. Decoding
//! them with a JSON parser fails on every non-empty payload, and a decoder that
//! swallows that failure reports "no keys" / "zero" instead of the real answer.
//! Every RESP handler that needs to look inside a payload goes through here.
