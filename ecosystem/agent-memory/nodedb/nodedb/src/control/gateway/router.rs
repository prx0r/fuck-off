//! Physical plan → `Vec<TaskRoute>` routing.
//!
//! The router consults the local [`RoutingTable`] to decide whether each
//! task runs locally or must be forwarded to a remote node.
//!
//! # Routing rules
//!
//! 1. Consult the `strategy_fn` closure (backed by the catalog) for the plan's
//!    primary collection to determine its [`PartitionStrategy`]:
//!    - `CollectionHomed` → one vShard derived from [`vshard_for_collection`].
//!    - `KeyPartitioned` → one vShard per distinct key via [`VShardId::from_key`]
//!      (deduplicated; multiple keys mapping to the same vShard share one route).
//! 2. Look up the Raft group leader for each vShard in the routing table.
//! 3. If the leader is this node (`local_node_id`) → `RouteDecision::Local`.
//! 4. If the leader is another node → `RouteDecision::Remote`.
//! 5. For plans wrapped in `QueryOp::Exchange{Gather{..}}` the Exchange wrapper
//!    is stripped and the child is routed by its data distribution: a genuinely
//!    cluster-partitioned child (graph traversal by node-id, array by tile) is
//!    broadcast to every vShard; a single-vShard-homed child (document / kv /
//!    columnar / timeseries / spatial / vector / text, and joins/aggregates over
//!    them) is routed to its ONE owning vShard — broadcasting it would duplicate
//!    rows, since the data-plane scan is not vshard-scoped.
//!
//! In single-node mode (routing table = `None`), all plans route locally.
