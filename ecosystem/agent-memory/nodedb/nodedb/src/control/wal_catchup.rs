//! WAL catch-up task for timeseries ingest.
//!
//! During sustained high-throughput ILP ingest, the SPSC bridge between
//! Control Plane and Data Plane may drop batches under backpressure.
//! Those batches are durable in WAL but invisible to queries because
//! they never reached the Data Plane memtable.
//!
//! This background task periodically scans WAL for TimeseriesBatch
//! records that haven't been delivered and re-dispatches them to the
//! Data Plane. It uses paginated mmap reads (bounded memory) and passes
//! WAL LSNs so the Data Plane can deduplicate already-ingested records.
