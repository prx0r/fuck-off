/// and the arm's resolved body (post-image for updates, the deleted row for
/// deletes so its PK can be extracted). `inserts` carry `(join_key, body)`.
///
/// An UPDATE arm additionally carries the target row's PRE-image as a fourth
/// element. A materialized-sum delta is the DIFFERENCE between the two images
/// and a join-key rewrite moves value between TWO targets, so the pre-image
/// join key has to be resolvable on the Control Plane; the post-image alone
