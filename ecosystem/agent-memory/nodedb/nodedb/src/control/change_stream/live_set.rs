//! Per-connection set of live CDC subscription forwarder tasks.
//!
//! WS `LIVE SELECT` subscriptions spawn a Tokio task per subscription that
//! forwards filtered change events to the connection's sender. Without
//! lifecycle tracking, a client that RST-s the TCP socket leaves the
//! forwarder tasks alive — each pinning a `Subscription` (broadcast
//! receiver + counter) until the broadcast channel closes.
//!
//! `LiveSubscriptionSet` owns a `JoinSet` of those tasks. Dropping the set
//! aborts every task; each abort causes the `Subscription` owned by the
//! task to drop, whose `Drop` decrements `active_subscriptions`. The WS
//! route moves this set into the connection's scope so disconnect tears
//! down every subscription opened by that connection.
