//! Coordinated checkpoint manager.
//!
//! Periodically dispatches `PhysicalPlan::Checkpoint` to all Data Plane cores,
//! collects their checkpoint LSNs, and truncates the WAL up to the global
//! minimum LSN — but only when every core has reported.
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! 1. The manager sends a `Checkpoint` request to every core via the Dispatcher.
//! 2. Each core flushes its engine state (vectors, CRDTs) and responds with
//!    its watermark LSN.
//! 3. The manager collects all responses. If any core failed to dispatch,
//!    missed its response deadline, or otherwise did not report a fresh
//!    flush LSN, the whole cycle is deferred — no marker, no truncation,
//!    no tombstone GC — and retried next cycle. Only when every core has
//!    reported does the global checkpoint LSN become the **minimum**
//!    across all cores, ensuring no core has unflushed state above the
//!    truncation point.
//! 4. The Event Plane's persisted watermarks are folded into that minimum as
//!    an equal floor. Its consumers recover only from the WAL suffix above
//!    them, so a truncation past a lagging consumer silently drops every CDC
//!    row, trigger fire and streaming-MV update in the gap.
//! 5. A `RecordType::Checkpoint` WAL record is written at the global LSN.
//! 6. `WalManager::truncate_before()` deletes old WAL segments.
//!
//! ## Frequency
//!
//! Default: every 5 minutes (matches the existing vector checkpoint interval).
//! Configurable via `CheckpointManagerConfig`.

/// lose the writes on restart. Also returns `None` when the minimum is 0
/// (no writes yet, nothing to truncate).
///
/// ## Why the Event Plane is a floor too
///
/// The engines are not the only consumer of the WAL. Each Event Plane consumer
/// recovers from exactly one place — the WAL suffix above its persisted
/// watermark — and that watermark is flushed lazily, so it always trails the
/// engines. Once a segment below a consumer's watermark is unlinked, that
/// suffix is gone: every CDC row, trigger fire, and streaming-MV update for the
/// acknowledged writes in it is unrecoverable. Replay now refuses a request
/// below the retained floor rather than returning the shorter suffix that
/// survives, so the loss is loud instead of silent — but refusing is only an
/// alarm. This floor is what keeps it from happening.
///
/// `event_watermarks` is therefore folded in exactly as each core's engine LSN
/// is, with the same conservatism: one entry per core, and a core that has
/// persisted nothing contributes 0, which defers the whole cycle. Deferring
/// costs WAL growth until the next cycle; not deferring costs the events.
