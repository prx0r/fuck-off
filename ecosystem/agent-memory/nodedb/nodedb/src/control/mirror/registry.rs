//! Registry of active cross-cluster observer links keyed by local `DatabaseId`.
//!
//! The registry is `Send + Sync` and lives on the Control Plane. Each mirror
//! database that is actively following a source cluster has one entry here.
//! When `ALTER DATABASE … PROMOTE` is issued the entry is removed and the
//! link is shut down before the catalog mutation lands.
//!
//! # Receive timestamp
//!
//! Each entry tracks `last_received_ms`: the wall-clock time at which the
//! mirror's apply loop most recently received an AppendEntries (or any
//! source-originated frame) over the link. The receive-side wiring calls
//! [`MirrorLinkRegistry::record_received`] on every inbound frame; the lag
//! monitor reads the value via [`MirrorLinkRegistry::last_received_ms`] to
//! drive the `Degraded → Disconnected` transition.
//!
//! Storing this on the registry (rather than on `CrossClusterLink`) keeps
//! the cluster crate free of timing concerns and lets the Control Plane own
//! the single source of truth for status decisions.
