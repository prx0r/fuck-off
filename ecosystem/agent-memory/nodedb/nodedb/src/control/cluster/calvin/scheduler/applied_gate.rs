//! Exactly-once applied gate for the Calvin scheduler.
//!
//! A Calvin epoch carries N independent transactions, one per `position`. Each
//! `(epoch, position)` is a distinct user transaction: a multi-participant txn
//! is ONE `(epoch, position)` spread across several vShard *slices*, but one
//! epoch routinely carries several positions touching the SAME vShard. Applying
//! one position of an epoch therefore says nothing about the others.
//!
//! [`AppliedGate`] tracks which `(epoch, position)` pairs a vShard has applied,
//! so the scheduler skips exactly the positions that already committed — never a
//! whole epoch on the strength of its first completing position. Skipping a
//! whole epoch after one position lost every other position of that epoch across
//! a restart (a torn transaction); the per-position gate is what prevents it.
//!
//! Two representations, one meaning ("this position is applied, do not re-run"):
//!
//! - [`AppliedGate::fully_applied_epoch`] (`W`) — a watermark: every position of
//!   every epoch `<= W` is applied. Compresses a contiguous fully-applied
//!   prefix into a single number so the tail set stays bounded.
//! - `applied_tail` — the applied `(epoch, position)` pairs for epochs `> W`.
//!
//! The gate is exact regardless of `W`'s value: `W` is only a memory bound, not
//! a correctness device. At recovery, `W` starts at the not-yet-applied sentinel
//! (nothing is *proven* fully applied without the per-epoch expected counts) and
//! the tail carries every applied marker read from the WAL; the watermark then
//! advances as the sequencer re-fans-out the log and the per-`(epoch, vShard)`
//! expected counts are learned.
