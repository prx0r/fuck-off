//! Post-apply write-version recording for committed Calvin transactions.
//!
//! A Calvin apply's committed WAL LSN is allocated only AFTER the apply
//! succeeds — the `CalvinApplied` WAL record is appended on the Control Plane
//! once the executor response returns — so the apply itself carries no
//! committed LSN and the per-core write-version index cannot be advanced in
//! place (the dispatch stamps `wal_lsn: None`). Once the scheduler has that
//! LSN it dispatches a one-way, record-only op back to the same core, which
//! funnels the transaction's locally-applied write plans through the shared
//! write-version recorder at that LSN — the same shard-local WAL-LSN space the
//! single-shard fast path and read watermarks use.
