//! Reservation submit/release primitives and sequencer-leader routing.
//!
//! Mirrors [`super::submit::submit_local_assign`] /
//! [`super::submit::submit_calvin_routed_assign`] exactly: reservation requests
//! (reserve-read admission, release-on-commit/abort) only complete correctly on
//! the sequencer-group leader, since the reservation service only assigns on
//! the leader and drains-and-discards elsewhere. The local primitives here
//! MUST run on the leader; the routed entry points resolve the leader and
//! either run locally (this node IS the leader) or forward via a one-shot RPC.
//!
//! # Plane discipline
//!
//! Runs on the coordinator's / leader's Control Plane (Tokio). The QUIC
//! `send_rpc` call is Control-Plane I/O, allowed here. This module never does
//! storage I/O or io_uring directly.
