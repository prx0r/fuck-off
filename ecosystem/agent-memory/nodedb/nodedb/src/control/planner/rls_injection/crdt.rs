//! RLS resolution for CRDT-engine operations.
//!
//! No CRDT read carries a filter slot: a document read returns the merged Loro
//! state and a delta export returns the oplog those states were built from.
//! Reads of row content therefore refuse while a policy applies, while reads
//! of collection configuration — the installed constraint set, the conflict
//! policy, the oplog version vector — carry no row content and pass.
//!
//! The two DML ops are the exception for the read half: a `RETURNING` clause on
//! them emits row bodies the handler holds in full, so they carry a post-fetch
//! filter slot and the policy lands there rather than refusing the statement.
//!
//! No CRDT write can be gated here at all: what gets persisted is always the
//! merge of the submitted change with the document's existing state, and that
//! merge runs in the Data Plane. A write policy on the collection therefore
//! refuses the statement rather than admitting an image it never saw.
