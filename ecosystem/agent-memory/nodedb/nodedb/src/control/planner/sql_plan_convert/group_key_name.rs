//! Shared GROUP BY key naming rule.
//!
//! A computed (non-column) GROUP BY key needs one canonical name shared by the
//! planner spec (the name the Data-Plane executor emits the evaluated value
//! under) and the response shaper (the `lookup_key` it reads that value back
//! by). Deriving both from this single helper guarantees they can never
//! diverge — a mismatch would surface the key value as a NULL cell.
//!
//! The name is index-based (`group_{index}`), not the SELECT alias: it is a
//! purely internal executor↔shaper handshake. The alias only ever reaches the
//! shaper's `display_name`, derived separately from `SqlPlan::Aggregate`'s
//! `group_by_aliases`.
