//! Routing gate for INSERT into a collection that declares `BALANCED ON (...)`.
//!
//! BALANCED is a write-BOUNDARY predicate: debits and credits arrive on
//! different rows, so the rows a statement writes are only meaningful together.
//! An `INSERT ... VALUES (a), (b)` normally lowers to ONE `PointInsert` TASK PER
//! ROW, and each task is a separate Data-Plane request — a separate boundary. On
//! a balanced collection that judges the first leg of a journal on its own,
//! which no journal can survive: the statement is refused before the second leg
//! is ever accounted.
//!
//! So an INSERT into a balanced collection lowers to a single
//! [`DocumentOp::BatchInsert`] page instead. That is the shape this codebase
//! already uses everywhere else rows arrive as a set (`INSERT ... SELECT`
//! lowers to it too), and it is what makes the statement one boundary: the page
//! applies inside ONE Data-Plane transaction, so its rows are judged together
//! and a refusal leaves none of them behind.
//!
//! The page shape is used for a single-row INSERT as well. Making it depend on
//! the row count would fork the write path on something the constraint does not
//! care about; a page of one row is judged exactly as a lone `PointInsert`
//! would be, and is refused for the same reason.
