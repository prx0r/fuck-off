/// Mark a collection as edge-bearing in the system catalog (idempotent).
///
/// Sets [`StoredCollection::has_implicit_edges`] to `true` the first time an
/// edge (implicit `_from`/`_to` document, or explicit `GRAPH INSERT EDGE`) is
/// written into `collection`. This is the routing gate for implicit-edge
/// DELETE / UPDATE cleanup — see `has_implicit_edges`'s doc comment.
///
/// Read-then-conditional-write: if the collection is already flagged the write
/// is SKIPPED, so the common steady-state insert path issues zero catalog
/// proposals (only the very first edge into a fresh collection pays the cost).
/// If the catalog is unavailable or the collection row is absent, this is a
/// no-op `Ok(())` — flag bookkeeping must never fail a write that otherwise
/// succeeds. A genuine propose/put error IS propagated (not swallowed).
///
/// The flag is committed via the REPLICATED metadata path
/// (`propose_catalog_entry` → `CatalogEntry::PutCollection`), exactly like
/// CREATE/ALTER COLLECTION. A bare local `put_collection` would only update the
/// proposing node's catalog, so a DELETE coordinated on a different node would
/// not observe the flag and would skip implicit-edge cleanup — the bug this
/// routing gate exists to prevent. The `log_index == 0` single-node path
/// bypasses the applier, so it writes through locally (mirrors the DDL handlers).
