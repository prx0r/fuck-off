//! Settling a CROSS-SHARD materialized-sum balance for a write whose delta is a
//! difference between two row images.
//!
//! # Why the insert path is not enough
//!
//! [`append_cross_shard_balance_tasks`](super::cross_shard) settles the shapes
//! whose delta the plan already determines: an insert's rows are new by
//! construction, so the whole of each row's value is credited and there is no
//! pre-image to subtract. Every other shape's delta is a difference — an
//! UPDATE's `new − old`, a DELETE's `−old`, a join-key MOVE's `−old` on one
//! target and `+new` on another, a PUT or UPSERT onto an existing row — and the
//! plan carries only one of the two images.
//!
//! The Control Plane already reads the other one. [`super::stored`] does a
//! routed point read for the point shapes and [`super::recon`] scans the
//! predicate for the bulk ones, both so the join values can be resolved at all.
//! Those images are folded HERE, in the same pass, from the same read: a second
//! pass would fold a different snapshot, and two snapshots is two totals.
//!
//! # Deferral is the ABSENCE of a resolution
//!
//! A settled binding's `(target collection, join value)` pairs are removed from
//! the source op's `resolved_sum_targets` before the plan leaves the Control
//! Plane — the pair, so a settled binding never strips the resolution of a
//! sibling binding that happens to read the same join column. The Data
//! Plane skips a delta whose binding is not co-resident AND whose join value it
//! holds no resolution for, so the delta lands exactly once — on the
//! [`ApplyBalanceDelta`](DocumentOp::ApplyBalanceDelta) task appended here,
//! homed on the target's vShard and dual-homed with the source write through
//! Calvin.
//!
//! Nothing is added to the source op to say so. A marker field would have to be
//! spelled on seven more plan variants and seven more replicated-write
//! variants, and every one of them is a place the marker and the appended task
//! can disagree. The resolution IS the marker: the plane-neutral
//! [`sum_target_is_co_resident`](crate::query::sum_target_is_co_resident) tells
//! both planes which bindings can ride the source transaction, and for the rest
//! the presence of a resolved surrogate is what says "nobody else is applying
//! this one".
//!
//! That leaves the Control-Plane orchestrators — `MERGE`, `UPDATE ... FROM`,
//! `INSERT ... SELECT` and the staged-transaction expanders — untouched: they
//! resolve their rows through
//! [`resolve_sum_targets_for_bodies`](super::resolve::resolve_sum_targets_for_bodies)
//! and dispatch through `dispatch_local` without ever reaching this pass, so
//! every join value they resolve stays resolved and the Data Plane keeps
//! applying their deltas exactly as before.
//!
//! # The images are only as good as the version they were read at
//!
//! The read happens before execution, so the source rows can move underneath
//! it, and a delta folded from a moved image is a wrong total that nothing
//! downstream can detect. So every settlement stamps the read it was folded
//! from as a [`ReadSetEntry`]. The entry travels on the transaction's Calvin
//! read-set, and the source core's `read_set_still_current` check votes ABORT —
//! before any row is mutated — when the rows it was folded from have been
//! written since. The statement then retries against a fresh read.
