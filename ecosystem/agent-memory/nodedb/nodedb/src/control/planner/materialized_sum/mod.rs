//! Control-Plane resolution of materialized-sum target rows.
//!
//! A materialized-sum binding joins a source row's `join_column` VALUE to the
//! TARGET collection's primary key. Turning that value into the target row's
//! storage key needs the PK→surrogate map, which lives in the catalog redb —
//! Control-Plane state the Data Plane never opens. So the resolution happens
//! here, at plan time, and travels on the plan in each write op's
//! `resolved_sum_targets` slot.
//!
//! # Plane discipline
//!
//! Runs on the coordinator's Control Plane (Tokio). The routed lookup performs
//! Control-Plane RPC I/O only — no storage I/O, no io_uring, no Data-Plane
//! access from this module.
