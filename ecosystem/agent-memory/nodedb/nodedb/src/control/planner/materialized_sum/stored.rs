//! Control-Plane resolution of the materialized-sum targets a write addresses
//! through its STORED row rather than through anything the plan carries.
//!
//! # The gap this closes
//!
//! A `PointDelete` names a row by key and carries no body. A `PointUpdate`
//! carries field assignments, not a whole row. Neither can say which target the
//! row it names contributes to, so both used to resolve nothing at all — and a
//! plain `UPDATE ... WHERE id = '…'` or `DELETE FROM … WHERE id = '…'` on a
//! collection driving a binding reached the Data-Plane fold with an empty
//! resolution and failed the statement outright.
//!
//! `PointPut` and `Upsert` onto an EXISTING row have the same gap from the other
//! side. They fold as an update of the stored row by the submitted body, so a
//! write that rewrites the join column moves value between TWO targets — and
//! only the target the body names was ever resolved. The one the row is leaving
//! is readable from the stored image and nowhere else.
//!
//! # Where the row comes from
//!
//! [`recon_point_row`] — the same routed plan-time read the predicate-driven
//! shapes use for their reconnaissance scan, narrowed to one row. There is
//! deliberately no second way to read a source row at plan time: two readers are
//! free to disagree about where a collection lives, and a disagreement here is a
//! resolution that silently misses a target.
//!
//! The Data Plane resolves nothing, here or anywhere: the primary-key →
//! surrogate map is catalog state, and a Data-Plane copy of it would be exactly
//! the cross-plane shared state the plane rules forbid.
//!
//! # Both sides of a join-key change
//!
//! [`binding_join_keys`](crate::query::binding_join_keys) turns the write's
//! IMAGES into join values, so the pre-image's value and the post-image's are
//! BOTH resolved. Resolving one side only leaves the other target's total wrong
//! by the row's whole value.
//!
//! The images are what it reads, not the assignments, because two of these four
//! shapes form their post-image from the submitted BODY as well: a put replaces
//! the stored row with it wholesale, and an upsert's conflict branch merges it
//! in — either by overlaying it when the statement carries no conflict
//! assignments, or by answering `EXCLUDED.col` from it when it does. Deriving
//! the keys from the assignments alone would name a target the fold never
//! addresses, and miss the one it does.
