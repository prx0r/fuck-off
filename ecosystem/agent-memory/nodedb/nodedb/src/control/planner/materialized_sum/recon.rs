//! The reconnaissance scan behind the predicate-driven materialized-sum
//! resolution.
//!
//! A `BulkUpdate` / `BulkDelete` / `TRUNCATE` names its rows by PREDICATE, not
//! by body: at plan time the Control Plane holds no row to read a join key off.
//! It reads them the same way the OLLP dependent-predicate path predicts its
//! write set — one scan of the same predicate, before execution — and resolves
//! the join values that scan surfaces.
//!
//! A `PointUpdate` / `PointDelete` names ONE row and carries no body either — an
//! update carries field assignments, a delete carries only a key — so its join
//! key is likewise only readable from the stored row.
//! [`recon_point_row`] reads that one row through the SAME routing, so there is
//! one way to read a source row at plan time rather than two that can disagree
//! about where the collection lives.
//!
//! Like the OLLP pre-execution scan, the read is routed through the gateway when
//! one is wired: a bare local dispatch on a coordinator that does not host the
//! collection's vShard returns nothing, which would silently under-resolve and
//! leave the write with no target to address.
//!
//! # Plane discipline
//!
//! Runs on the coordinator's Control Plane (Tokio). The scan crosses the SPSC
//! bridge (or the gateway) exactly as a `SELECT` does — no storage I/O and no
//! io_uring here.
