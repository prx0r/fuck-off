//! Gate handles for the [`StartupSequencer`].
//!
//! Two complementary types:
//!
//! - [`StartupGate`] — a shared, cheaply-cloneable read handle that any
//!   Control Plane code can hold to observe the current phase or `await`
//!   a specific phase before proceeding.
//! - [`ReadyGate`] — a single-use write handle returned by
//!   [`StartupSequencer::register_gate`]. When a subsystem completes its
//!   startup work it calls [`ReadyGate::fire`]. If the subsystem fails it
//!   calls [`ReadyGate::fail`]. Dropping a [`ReadyGate`] without firing it
//!   automatically transitions the sequencer to `Failed` — a dropped gate
//!   that never fired would otherwise deadlock startup forever.
