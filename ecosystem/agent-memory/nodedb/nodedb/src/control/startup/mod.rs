//! Deterministic startup phase sequencer.
//!
//! Every node advances through a fixed sequence of [`StartupPhase`] values.
//! The **gate model** ([`StartupSequencer`]) is the canonical API: every
//! subsystem that must complete before a phase transition registers a
//! [`ReadyGate`] and fires it when it finishes startup work. The sequencer
//! advances automatically when all gates for a phase have fired.
//!
//! Observers — listeners, health checks — hold an [`Arc<StartupGate>`] and
//! call [`StartupGate::await_phase`] to block until a specific phase is
//! reached.
