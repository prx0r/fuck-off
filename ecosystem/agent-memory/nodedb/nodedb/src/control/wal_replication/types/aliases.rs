/// success, the Data Plane apply payload bytes together with the write's
/// per-collection version: the written collection's `coll_write_lsn` AFTER the
/// write, as the replica that applied the entry recorded it. It is a WAL LSN,
/// minted by the apply path's own WAL append — NOT the Raft log index, which is
/// a per-group counter sharing no scale with the WAL LSNs the version index is
/// otherwise fed. Callers that need the write's version (e.g. a
/// read-your-writes floor for cross-shard OCC, which validates in the WAL-LSN
/// domain) read it here without a second lookup; it is `Lsn::ZERO` for a write
/// whose plan names no single user collection, which records no such version.
/// The `idempotency_key` matches the one embedded in the
/// serialized `ReplicatedEntry`; the proposer registers the tracker waiter with
/// this key so apply-side mismatch detection can surface `RetryableLeaderChange`
/// when a new leader's entry overwrites this one.
