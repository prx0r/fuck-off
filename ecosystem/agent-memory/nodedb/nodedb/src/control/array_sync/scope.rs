//! Scoped identity types for array CRDT sync.

//! Array sync state is keyed by the full `(database, tenant, array)` identity
//! so two arrays sharing a name in different databases can never alias each
//! other. These aliases name that key once instead of repeating the tuple at
//! every map, field, and signature that carries it.
