//! Apply a committed Raft-native array cell write (`ArrayCellPut` /
//! `ArrayCellDelete`) on the local node.
//!
//! This is the apply half of the cluster SQL DML array path: the owner
//! proposed `ReplicatedWrite::ArrayCellPut` / `ArrayCellDelete` to the shard's
//! data Raft group; every replica (the proposer included) lands here after
//! commit. Unlike the plain committed-write path, an array Put/Delete requires
//! the Data Plane to have the array OPEN first — so this runs the array-open
//! bootstrap in [`super::common`] and THEN hands the write to the shared
//! Control-Plane write funnel, which mints this replica's redo record before the
//! enqueue and fsyncs it before the apply is reported durable. The bootstrap is
//! a prerequisite step, not a reason to bypass the funnel: an entry applied
//! without a redo record has no durability at all once the applied floor
//! advances past it and Raft stops redelivering it.
//!
//! Distinct from [`super::op::apply_array_op`], which applies a single Lite-sync
//! CRDT op through the array-sync op-log / HLC dedup. Here idempotency is the
//! Raft log's exactly-once ordering plus the array engine's coord-keyed
//! overwrite semantics (re-applying a Put re-writes the identical cell; a
//! Delete of an absent coord is a no-op), so no op-log entry is recorded.
