//! WAL appender for surrogate hwm flushes.
//!
//! Decouples the registry's flush path from a concrete `WalManager`
//! handle so tests can substitute a no-op (or in-memory) appender
//! without spinning up a real WAL. Production wires
//! [`WalSurrogateAppender`].
//!
//! The appender is invoked from [`crate::control::surrogate::assign`]
//! immediately after the catalog hwm row has been persisted. Order is
//! load-bearing for crash recovery: post-restart we read the catalog
//! row first; the WAL record is only consulted if the catalog is
//! behind (S2 will wire the actual replay path).
