//! Key: `tenant_id (u64)`.
//! Value: MessagePack-serialized [`MoveTenantJournalEntry`].
//!
//! The journal makes `MOVE TENANT` crash-safe: on startup, the recovery path
//! scans for in-progress entries and either completes or compensates each one.
//!
//! These live with the catalog rather than with the `MOVE TENANT` workflow that
//! drives them, because the catalog is what owns the redb table: it creates the
//! table at bootstrap and it is the only module that can reach
//! `SystemCatalog::db` to read and write rows. A workflow that reaches the
//! other way — a catalog table defined above the catalog — would make the
//! lower layer depend on the higher one.
