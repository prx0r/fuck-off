/// The two dispositions demand opposite sender behaviour, so they are variants
/// of one enum rather than two independent fields:
///
/// * [`Self::Ack`] — the frame reached a client-visible status. Every variant
///   of [`AckStatus`] is non-terminal or successful; in particular
///   [`AckStatus::Gap`] is a **retryable refusal**, meaning nothing applied and
///   the identical frame at the same sequence is expected to succeed once a
///   transient precondition resolves. The high-water-mark is deliberately held
///   so that re-push is admitted rather than deduplicated to `Duplicate`.
/// * [`Self::Rejected`] — the frame will never apply. The sender must
///   compensate rather than retry, and the high-water-mark advances so a dead
///   frame cannot wedge the stream.
///
/// Carrying a status *and* an independent rejection reason is what let a
/// retryable refusal be read as a permanent one: a producer with a reason to
/// report had to smuggle it through the terminal channel, and a consumer that
/// checked the terminal channel first never saw the retryable status behind it.
/// One field makes that state unrepresentable.
