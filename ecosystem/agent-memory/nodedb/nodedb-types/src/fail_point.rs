//! Minimal feature-gated fail-point framework for crash-injection tests.
//!
//! When the `failpoints` Cargo feature is OFF (the default and what release
//! builds compile with), `fail_point!(name)` expands to nothing — zero
//! runtime cost.
//!
//! When the feature is ON, each invocation looks up `name` in a process-wide
//! registry. If a [`FailAction`] has been installed for that name, the action
//! fires:
//!   - `Panic`: panic immediately with a message naming the fail point.
//!   - `Sleep(d)`: sleep for `d`, useful for race-condition tests.
//!   - `Fail(detail)`: make the injected call site return an error. Only
//!     [`fail_point_err!`] can honour this — the call site supplies the
//!     mapping into its own error type, so no crate has to know about
//!     anyone else's.
//!
//! The framework is deliberately tiny — no fail-rs dep, no parsing of env
//! vars, no list of probabilities. Tests install actions explicitly via
//! `set` / `clear` and must clean up in their own teardown (or use
//! `FailGuard` for RAII cleanup).
//!
//! Feature gating is per-crate: the macros expand under the *calling* crate's
//! `failpoints` feature, so every crate that injects a fail point declares its
//! own `failpoints = ["nodedb-types/failpoints"]`.
