//! A cross-shard, Calvin-committed write RECORDS its write-version in the
//! per-core write-version index — closing the gap where Calvin applies advanced
//! no version at all (fast-path writes and reads already do).
//!
//! The version index itself lives on the `!Send` Data-Plane core and its
//! readers are test-only, so this asserts the recording FIRED via the
//! node-global `calvin_counters.write_versions_recorded` counter, which the per-vShard
//! scheduler increments once per committed Calvin apply for which it dispatched
//! a write-version record op (at the CalvinApplied WAL LSN). The counter is the
//! standalone-observable proof that a cross-shard-committed write now advances
//! the version index; the end-to-end serializability regression (via read-set
//! validation) is covered separately once validation is enforcing.
