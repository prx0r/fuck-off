//! Cross-shard OCC read validation for an in-transaction DISTRIBUTED
//! GATHER-JOIN read driven over the NATIVE (MessagePack) transport.
//!
//! Native mirror of `gather_join_in_txn_occ.rs`. A cross-vShard equi-join lowers
//! to `Exchange{Gather{HashJoin}}` BY DEFAULT (no forced shuffle): the `HashJoin`
//! is routed to the LEFT/probe collection's vShard and the RIGHT/build collection
//! is GATHERED across all vShards, with a per-collection `DistributedReadCapture`
//! emitted for each side. The native dispatch loop once DROPPED those captures, so
//! an in-txn distributed read on native recorded only the collapsed left
//! collection — the build side's read-version was discarded, its vShard never
//! revalidated at the Calvin barrier, and a concurrent build-side write silently
//! committed a stale join — now fixed by feeding the same captures pgwire uses.
//!
//! Cases bounding the fixed behavior:
//!  * `commits_when_neither_side_concurrently_written` — clean commit MUST SUCCEED
//!    (captures carry the sound `coll_write_lsn`, not an over-aborting watermark).
//!  * `occ_aborts_on_stale_probe_read` — a stale LEFT/probe read MUST abort.
//!  * `occ_aborts_on_stale_build_read` — a stale RIGHT/build read (pgwire rival)
//!    MUST abort: the native build-side capture hole is closed on the Gather path.
//!  * `occ_aborts_on_native_writer_stale_read` — the build-side rival is a NATIVE
//!    autocommit INSERT. Pre-fix the gateway leader-local autocommit path never
//!    proposed a Raft entry nor bumped `coll_write_lsn`, so the read never went
//!    stale and COMMIT silently succeeded; routing native writes through Raft
//!    closes that lost-update cell.
//!
//! Determinism: each rival write is confirmed VISIBLE (autocommit `SELECT`) before
//! COMMIT, so the read is provably stale and the abort guaranteed. Native surfaces
//! it as text "could not serialize access due to concurrent update".
