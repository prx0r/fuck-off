//! Regression guard: `OriginCatalog::get_collection` must read
//! purely from the local `SystemCatalog` redb — never dispatch a
//! cluster RPC. If a future change adds a network-hopping read
//! path to planning, query latency becomes unbounded under slow
//! peers, and RLS cache lookups start cascading across the
//! cluster. This test pins the invariant in place: we plan a
//! SELECT on a single-node cluster where the cluster transport
//! is healthy but the SELECT itself does not need remote
//! dispatch, and we assert the plan completes in the local
//! tokio runtime with no spawn_blocking detour.
