//! Cross-shard OCC read validation for an in-transaction DISTRIBUTED
//! shuffle-AGGREGATE read, exercised on a single single-node-calvin node.
//!
//! ## The hazard this pins
//!
//! An interactive transaction can WRITE several collections and READ another via
//! a distributed GROUP BY that the planner lowers to `Exchange{ShuffleAggregate}`.
//! The coordinator fans partial-state PRODUCERs to the source collection's
//! owner(s); each producer scans the collection and — with the producer-side
//! read-version fix — reports the scanned collection's `coll_write_lsn` at read
//! time back on its `ShuffleProduceResponse`. The coordinator max-folds those and
//! records the aggregate's read-set entry with that version.
//!
//! Before the fix the shuffle-aggregate resolver recorded `Lsn::ZERO` as the
//! read version. At the cross-shard COMMIT barrier the read-only participant is
//! revalidated with `coll_write_lsn(coll) <= read_version`; with `read_version =
//! 0` and any prior write to the collection (`coll_write_lsn > 0`) the comparison
//! is `>0 <= 0` → false → a SPURIOUS serialization abort (SQLSTATE 40001) for a
//! read that was never concurrently written. This suite bounds the behavior from
//! BOTH sides:
//!
//! * `commits_when_not_concurrently_written` — the read collection is NOT written
//!   during the txn, so the recorded real version still validates and COMMIT must
//!   SUCCEED. This is exactly what the ZERO→real-version fix unblocks; before the
//!   fix this direction spuriously aborted with 40001.
//! * `aborts_on_stale_read` — a confirmed-visible concurrent write advances the
//!   read collection past the captured version, so COMMIT must STILL abort with
//!   40001. This guards the fix against degrading into a blanket "always valid".
//!
//! ## Why a single node reproduces it
//!
//! The OCC hazard is cross-vShard, NOT cross-node. A single single-node-calvin
//! node with 4 Data-Plane cores leads every data group locally AND has a cluster
//! transport + the shuffle producer hook installed, so it can BOTH resolve a
//! distributed `Exchange{ShuffleAggregate}` (producer/consumer loop back to the
//! same node over the real RPC path, so the producer-side read-version reporting
//! is genuinely exercised) AND route a cross-shard COMMIT through the
//! multi-participant Calvin barrier that revalidates read-only participants.
//!
//! The transaction WRITES two collections on DISTINCT vShards (`w1`, `w2`) so its
//! write set spans two vShards → participant floor `>= 2` → COMMIT routes through
//! the Calvin barrier rather than the single-shard fast path. It READS a third
//! collection (`metrics`, on a distinct vShard) via a forced distributed GROUP BY,
//! making `metrics`'s vShard a read-only participant whose captured read slice the
//! barrier revalidates.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! No fixed sleep governs correctness. The concurrent write to `metrics` is issued
//! on a separate connection and confirmed VISIBLE (via an autocommit `SELECT` on a
//! third connection) BEFORE the coordinator's COMMIT is issued, so the aggregate
//! read is provably stale at commit time — the abort is guaranteed, never racy.
