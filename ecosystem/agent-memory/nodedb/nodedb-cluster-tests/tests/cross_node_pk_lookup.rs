//! Cross-node PK point-lookup correctness from a non-member coordinator.
//!
//! ## The bug this guards against
//!
//! A PK point-lookup (`SELECT ... WHERE id = <pk>`) resolves pk → surrogate on
//! the QUERY COORDINATOR's local catalog. The surrogate↔PK map
//! (`surrogate_pk{,_rev}_v3`) is SHARDED to the collection's data-group
//! members. `document_strict` collections are single-vShard-homed, so when the
//! coordinator is NOT a member of that group, resolution misses → the
//! coordinator ships `Surrogate::ZERO` to the owner → the owner does
//! `surrogate_to_doc_id(ZERO)` → the row is NOT FOUND. So cross-node PK reads
//! from a non-member coordinator silently returned EMPTY.
//!
//! Scans are unaffected: they route + scan on the owner with no surrogate
//! resolution, which is why `COUNT(*)` worked even while the point-get failed.
//!
//! ## The fix being verified
//!
//! The owner's `exec_receiver` re-resolves a ZERO `DocumentOp::PointGet`
//! surrogate against ITS OWN local catalog (it is a group member, so it holds
//! the binding) after decoding the plan and before dispatching to the Data
//! Plane. After the fix, the point-get must succeed from EVERY coordinator in
//! the cluster — member or not.
//!
//! ## Test shape
//!
//!  1. Spawn a 3-node cluster, create a `document_strict` collection with a PK,
//!     insert a few rows via one node, and converge.
//!  2. For EVERY node, `SELECT payload FROM coll WHERE id = 'row-0'` and assert
//!     it returns the expected value. Before the fix, the non-member
//!     coordinator(s) returned nothing.
//!  3. Sanity: `COUNT(*)` from every node equals the row count (scans already
//!     worked even with the bug — this proves the cluster is healthy and the
//!     point-get failure was isolated to surrogate resolution).
