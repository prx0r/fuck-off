//! Regression test for the "remote scan truncated to one chunk" cross-node bug.
//!
//! A SELECT whose result exceeds `stream_chunk_size` (default 1000 rows) is
//! emitted by the Data Plane as several `Partial` frames followed by a terminal
//! frame. On the LOCAL dispatch path the Control Plane drains and concatenates
//! every frame. The cross-node remote executor (`LocalPlanExecutor`), however,
//! used to consume only the FIRST frame off the response channel — so a SELECT
//! issued from a node that does not lead the collection's vShard returned only
//! the first 1000-row chunk and silently dropped the rest (and orphaned the
//! request's tracker entry).
//!
//! After the fix the remote executor drains the full bounded response, so a
//! SELECT returns every row regardless of which node it is issued from.
//!
//! The collection is a single-vShard-homed standard collection, so all rows
//! live on ONE owning vShard. The node that leads that vShard answers locally
//! (always correct); the other two nodes route the scan to it over QUIC and so
//! exercise the remote-drain path. Asserting the full count from every node
//! therefore covers both.
