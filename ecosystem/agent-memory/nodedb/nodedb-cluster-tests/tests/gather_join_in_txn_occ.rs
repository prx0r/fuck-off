//! Cross-shard OCC read validation for an in-transaction DISTRIBUTED
//! GATHER-JOIN read, exercised on a single single-node-calvin node.
//!
//! ## What this pins (and how it differs from the shuffle-JOIN suite)
//!
//! A cross-vShard equi-join lowers to `Exchange{Gather}` wrapping a `HashJoin`
//! BY DEFAULT — no `nodedb.force_shuffle_join`, no ANALYZE stats. The coordinator
//! routes the whole `HashJoin` to the LEFT (probe) collection's owning vShard,
//! where the left side is scanned locally, and GATHERS the RIGHT (build)
//! collection across all vShards (`gather_join_build_side`) to inline it as a
//! `ProviderScan`. Each of those two gathers observes its own collection's
//! `coll_write_lsn` at read time.
//!
//! Before the fix the GATHER path had a serializability HOLE: only the plan's
//! collapsed left collection reached the read-set (`extract_collection` of an
//! `Exchange{Gather{HashJoin}}` returns the left collection), while the build
//! side's gathered read-version was DISCARDED — its vShard was never validated at
//! commit. A concurrent write to the build collection between the in-txn read and
//! COMMIT went UNDETECTED and the transaction silently committed a stale join.
//! The fix threads a per-collection capture accumulator through the Gather
//! resolution so BOTH sides are recorded, mirroring the shuffle path.
//!
//! Three cases bound the fixed behavior:
//!
//!  * `commits_when_neither_side_concurrently_written` — neither join side is
//!    written during the txn, so both recorded real versions still validate and
//!    COMMIT must SUCCEED (proves the captures carry the sound per-collection
//!    `coll_write_lsn`, not an inflated global watermark that would over-abort).
//!  * `occ_aborts_on_stale_probe_read` — a confirmed-visible concurrent write to
//!    the LEFT/probe collection advances it past the captured probe version, so
//!    COMMIT must abort with 40001.
//!  * `occ_aborts_on_stale_build_read` — THE LOAD-BEARING CASE: a
//!    confirmed-visible concurrent write to the RIGHT/build collection ONLY must
//!    STILL abort with 40001. Pre-fix, no read-set entry existed for the build
//!    collection, so this would have SILENTLY committed. This case proves the
//!    hole is closed on the NATURAL Gather path (no forced shuffle).
//!
//! ## Why a single node reproduces it
//!
//! The OCC hazard is cross-vShard, NOT cross-node. A single single-node-calvin
//! node with 4 Data-Plane cores leads every data group locally AND has the
//! gateway installed, so it BOTH resolves a real `Exchange{Gather{HashJoin}}`
//! (routing the join to the probe vShard and gathering the build collection
//! across vShards) AND routes a cross-shard COMMIT through the multi-participant
//! Calvin barrier that revalidates read-only participants.
//!
//! The transaction WRITES two collections on DISTINCT vShards (`w1`, `w2`) so its
//! write set spans two vShards → participant floor `>= 2` → COMMIT routes through
//! the Calvin barrier rather than the single-shard fast path. It READS two more
//! collections (`left`, `right`, each on a distinct vShard) via the distributed
//! gather join, making both join sides' vShards read-only participants whose
//! captured read slices the barrier revalidates.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! No fixed sleep governs correctness. Each concurrent write is issued on a
//! separate connection and confirmed VISIBLE (via an autocommit `SELECT` on a
//! third connection) BEFORE the coordinator's COMMIT is issued, so the join read
//! is provably stale at commit time — the abort is guaranteed, never racy.
