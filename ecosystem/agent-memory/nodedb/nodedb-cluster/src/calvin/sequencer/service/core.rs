//! The Calvin sequencer service.
//!
//! [`SequencerService`] drives the epoch ticker and Raft proposal loop on the
//! sequencer leader. On each tick it:
//!
//! 1. Checks that this node is the sequencer Raft group leader. If not, drains
//!    and discards the inbox (clients will retry against the real leader).
//! 2. Runs the leader duties that mint nothing — verdict re-drive and
//!    reservation servicing. These never wait on the epoch seed.
//! 3. Drains the inbox into a candidate batch respecting epoch caps.
//! 4. Runs the pre-validation pass
//!    ([`crate::calvin::sequencer::validator::validate_batch`]).
//! 5. Proposes the resulting `EpochBatch` to the sequencer Raft group (only if
//!    at least one transaction was admitted).
//! 6. Advances the local epoch counter.
//!
//! The service does **not** apply Raft log entries — that is the
//! [`SequencerStateMachine`]'s job, which runs on every
//! replica including the leader.
