//! Lifecycle state of a schema descriptor.

//! lets in-flight DML observe a safe view of the schema during online DDL.
//! Every descriptor carries its current state; the
//! [`crate::metadata_group::cache::MetadataCache`] exposes the state to
//! planners so they can reject plans that would observe a partially-applied
//! change.
