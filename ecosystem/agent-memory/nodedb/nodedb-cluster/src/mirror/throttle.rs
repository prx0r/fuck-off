//! Send-rate throttle for cross-cluster mirror observers.
//!
//! The source side tracks bytes-in-flight for every connected mirror observer.
//! When the in-flight byte count exceeds [`SendThrottle::cap`] the source
//! stops pushing new snapshot chunks or log entries for that mirror until the
//! observer drains below [`SendThrottle::resume_threshold`].
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The throttle is intentionally simple: a per-mirror `AtomicU64` counter.
//! The source increments it before writing a chunk over the QUIC stream and
//! decrements it when the observer's ack arrives.  If the ack is never
//! received (e.g. the observer crashes mid-stream) the counter stays high
//! until the link is torn down, at which point [`SendThrottle::reset`] brings
//! it back to zero.
//!
//! This matches the `ObserverState::MAX_PENDING` entry-count cap in
//! `nodedb-raft` but operates at the byte level so large snapshot chunks do
//! not slip through.
