/// The transport server provides a `ChunkSink` whose `send_chunk` writes one
/// `RPC_EXECUTE_STREAM_CHUNK` envelope to the QUIC stream and awaits the write
/// inline, so QUIC flow control back-pressures the producer (the local stream
/// pull) when the coordinator falls behind.
///
/// `send_chunk` returning `Err` means the client / coordinator is gone (the
/// stream was reset or finished early): the producer MUST stop pulling and
/// return without writing a terminal frame.
///
/// `read_version_lsn` is that frame's per-collection read version (its scanned
/// collection's `coll_write_lsn` at read time), distinct from the core-global
/// `watermark_lsn`. The shuffle fan-out sink max-folds it so the producer can
/// report the observed read version for cross-shard OCC validation; the plain
/// `ExecuteStream` sink (which only carries `watermark_lsn` on the wire) ignores
/// it.
