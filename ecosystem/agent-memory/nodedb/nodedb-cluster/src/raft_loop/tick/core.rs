//! Single tick of the Raft event loop.
//!
//! Ordering (each phase uses a short-lived `MultiRaft` lock acquisition —
//! the lock is never held across an `.await`):
//!
//! 1. **Tick Raft groups**: drive election timeouts / heartbeats and pull
//!    `MultiRaftReady` output (messages, vote requests, committed
//!    entries, snapshot-needed peers).
//! 2. **Dispatch AppendEntries**: one background task per peer, batching
//!    all messages targeting the same peer (see [`super::dispatch_outbound`]).
//! 3. **Dispatch RequestVote**: same batching strategy.
//! 4. **Apply committed entries**: feed them to the user-supplied
//!    `CommitApplier`. Conf-change entries are detected and applied to
//!    `MultiRaft` before the user applier sees them (see
//!    [`super::apply_committed`]).
//! 5. **Install snapshots**: send `InstallSnapshot` RPCs to peers that
//!    have fallen behind the leader's snapshot boundary (see
//!    [`super::snapshot_dispatch`]).
//! 6. **Converge entering learners**: for each group this node leads,
//!    propose `AddLearner` for placement nodes not yet present as
//!    voters or learners. Re-proposals while a conf-change is pending
//!    are harmlessly rejected by Raft and retried next tick.
//! 7. **Promote caught-up learners**: for every group where this node is
//!    leader, query learners whose `match_index >= commit_index` and
//!    propose `PromoteLearner` for each. Idempotent by design — after
//!    the first promotion the peer has moved from `learners` to
//!    `members` and won't be returned again.
//! 8. **Remove leaving voters**: for each group this node leads, propose
//!    `RemoveNode` for committed voters no longer in the placement set —
//!    capped so the group never drops below RF committed voters, one at a
//!    time, and never removing the group leader.
//! 9. **Remove leaving learners**: for each group this node leads that has an
//!    authored placement set, propose `RemoveLearner` for non-voting learners
//!    not in the placement. Inert while placement is `None` (bootstrap window).
