//! Builder-chain methods for [`RaftLoop`].
//!
//! Every `with_*` method is a consumed-self builder that sets one optional
//! field and returns `Self` (or a new `RaftLoop` with a different generic when
//! the type changes, as with `with_plan_executor`).  They live here rather
//! than in [`super::loop_core`] so that the struct definition, constructor,
//! and runtime methods stay under the file-size limit.
