//! The identity of one materialized-sum target row, as the Control Plane
//! resolved it.
//!
//! A binding is `source.join_column -> target.target_column`, and one source
//! collection may drive SEVERAL bindings. Two of them can share a join column
//! and still point at different target collections — `entries.account_id` into
//! both `accounts.balance` and `audit_totals.balance`, say. The join VALUE those
//! two bindings read off a row is then identical, and it names two different
//! rows in two different collections.
//!
//! So a resolution keyed by the join value alone cannot express the answer. It
//! resolves the first binding, sees the value already present, skips the second,
//! and every consumer that looks the value up gets the FIRST binding's target
//! row — which the read-modify-write then writes the second binding's balance
//! into. No error is raised on either plane: both totals are simply wrong.
//!
//! The key is therefore the PAIR, and every producer and every consumer keys on
//! the pair.
