//! Control-Plane cluster array operations.
//!
//! These variants are emitted by the SQL converter when cluster mode is
//! active and an array operation spans multiple vShards. They are handled
//! exclusively by the Control-Plane dispatch loop (pgwire routing handler)
//! which calls the `ArrayCoordinator` before anything touches the SPSC
//! bridge. They are **never sent to the Data Plane**.
//!
//! The converter emits local `ArrayOp` variants in single-node mode and
//! `ClusterArrayOp` variants in cluster mode. Downstream code that sees
//! a `PhysicalPlan::ClusterArray(_)` knows it must call the coordinator,
//! not the SPSC bridge.
