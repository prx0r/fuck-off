"""Lab mode — Phase L1: ingest a lab's full publication corpus from OpenAlex.

Topic mode starts from a query and searches outward; LAB MODE starts from a
known set of papers (a lab's output), derives the themes, tracks them over time,
and only then searches outward to place them in the field. This tool fetches the
corpus — the seed everything else hangs off.

Give it an OpenAlex author id (recommended — use --search first to find it).
"All papers from a lab" is approximated by a PI's authored works. Pass several
ids with repeated --author for either of two reasons: to widen coverage to key
lab members, OR because ONE PERSON's record is split across ids, which is common
and easy to miss. Works are deduplicated by OpenAlex id.

  python3 tools/lab_corpus.py --search "Jack Gallant"          # find the id
  python3 tools/lab_corpus.py --author A5056348548 --out lab_papers.json
  python3 tools/lab_corpus.py --author A50… --author A51… --out lab_papers.json

Output: lab_papers.json — one row per paper with ref / title / year / doi / link
/ apa / venue / cite_openalex / topics / abstract(summary) / coauthors / type.

Disambiguation is the #1 correctness risk, and it cuts BOTH ways. An id can be
MERGED (holding several namesakes, so Phase L2 must prune) or SPLIT (one person
across several ids, so Phase L2 must ADD — and nothing fails when a record is
simply missing). --search prints the year span and ORCID for exactly this reason;
read its warnings.  See PLAYBOOK "Lab mode".

    This listing is the single point where disambiguation happens, and it used to
    show name / works / cites / first institution — none of which reliably
    identifies a person. Five real bootstraps produced four different failure
    shapes, and the affiliation label was misleading in three of them:

      * the id labeled with the right university had 3 works while the correct id
        showed an unrelated institution and had 130;
      * TWO candidates carried the institution being searched for and neither was
        the right person (one was a glaciologist), while the correct id was still
        labeled with the PI's PREVIOUS university because the lab had just moved;
      * a search returned exactly ONE plausible id — which feels like the safe
        case and is the worst, because the collisions had been merged INTO it: it
        spanned 1976-2026 and held at least five different people;
      * a search returned THREE ids that were ALL the same person, one holding a
        single high-profile paper. Fetching only the largest silently produced an
        incomplete corpus, and nothing fails when a record is merely absent.

    So print the two signals that do discriminate — the ORCID, and the
    publication year span — plus every last-known institution rather than the
    first, and warn on the two shapes that are detectable from the listing alone.
