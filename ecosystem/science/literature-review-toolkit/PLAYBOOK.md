# Literature Review Agent Playbook

**Purpose.** Build or extend a bibliography for an academic review topic, and
optionally render it as a figure and a written review. This is ONE tool with two
front-ends — **topic mode** (start from a query) and **lab mode** (start from a
lab's corpus) — that share the entire downstream pipeline; only the front-end
differs. Per topic, aim for ~50-70 high-impact and recent papers, classified and
summarised. Decide the mode first (Phase 0), then gather that mode's inputs.

## Operating contract — the rules that don't bend

These are the load-bearing invariants. Everything below the contract is reference
detail that elaborates them; when in doubt, obey this list. Section pointers are in
parentheses. Treat bold emphasis elsewhere in this file as ordinary guidance — the
genuinely inviolable rules are *only* the eight here.

1. **Verify EVERY citation before it enters a deliverable** (Phase 3). About 1 in 4
   agent-returned refs has a fabricated author list, wrong year, reversed
   conclusion, or bad DOI. No exceptions — preprints included.
2. **Every reference is canonical** (Phase 3f). Rebuild each `apa` from the verified
   DOI/arXiv with `references.py`; never ship an agent-typed or OpenAlex-typed
   string. `references.py --audit` is a hard gate (exit 1) — run it before every
   deliverable.
3. **One row per DOI** — global dedup; a paper appears once in `rows.json`. Bites
   hardest at the lab-mode merge, where one paper surfaces under several
   theme-searches and a lab paper can resurface as "field" (Phase L4c). (Distinct
   from the *one-family-per-paper* rule, which `families.py` enforces automatically
   — Phase 6b. This contract item is only about row-level deduplication.)
4. **Run the antecedents pass on every review, both modes** (Phase 2b). The forward
   search misses the topic's methodological, empirical, and theoretical roots;
   without it the field looks ~10 years old.
5. **Audit the temporal order of ideas before delivering any written review**
   (Phase 7). Origin claims must cite the EARLIEST deserving paper, oldest-first —
   not whichever ref fits the sentence.
6. **`rows.json` is the live table after Phase 3f.** Edit it by hand for any later
   change; never re-run the row-emitter (it wipes canonical `apa` + citation counts).
7. **Don't ask before fetching** from PubMed/PMC/CrossRef/OpenAlex/Unpaywall/arXiv/
   publishers — these are read-only academic GETs; do confirm destructive or
   shared-state actions. Every link is a bare `https://doi.org/<doi>` (never a
   libproxy URL). Set a contact email (`LITREVIEW_EMAIL` or `--email`) for the API
   User-Agent.
8. **PDFs are opt-in** (Phase 4) — default no, and never ask whether to fetch them.

**Default tier criteria.** Pre-2021: only highly cited / foundational. 2022+:
promiscuous (no citation-count gate — too recent to have accrued cites). The
boundary is "today minus ~5 years"; advance it as the calendar moves.

## Documentation site — keep it in sync

There is a public documentation website built from `docs/` (MkDocs + Material),
live at **https://gallantlab.org/literature-review-toolkit/**. It is a *superset*
of this PLAYBOOK and the README, not a fork. **When you change the toolkit — a
tool, a phase, a command/flag, a guardrail or lesson — update the matching page
under `docs/` in the same change** (fastest to drift: `docs/phases.md`,
`docs/tools.md`, `docs/pipeline.md`). It auto-deploys via
`.github/workflows/docs.yml` on push to `main` (build runs `mkdocs build
--strict`). Full editing/figure/snippet details live in `docs/maintaining.md`.
The repo is **public** (that's what enables free Pages); `site_url` uses the org's
`gallantlab.org` custom domain, not `github.io`.

---

## Phase 0 — choose the mode (do this first)

One tool, two front-ends. Everything after the front-end — verify, citation
counts, families, figure, spreadsheet — is the SAME shared machinery, run the
same way. There are no mode-specific shortcuts.

| Mode | Start from | User says… | Front-end | Then gather |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Topic** | a query/topic | "lit review on X", "extend the bibliography for Y" | Phase 1 (scope) → 2 (search) → **2b (antecedents)** | topic name + 1-paragraph definition, source doc if any, target spreadsheet path, tier criteria |
| **Lab** | a lab's publications | "review lab Z's work", "how has Z's research evolved" | Phase L1–L3 (ingest corpus → derive themes) → **L4c** (+ **2b antecedents**) | the lab/author ids, the inclusion filter (e.g. human-only), target paths |

**Phase 2b (antecedents) is required in both modes** — the forward search misses a
topic's methodological, empirical, and theoretical roots; do not skip it.

Both then converge on the shared pipeline: **Phase 3 verify → 3f canonicalize refs → 5 spreadsheet →
5b citation counts → 6 cross-citation → 6b families → 7 review article (optional) → 8 hand-off.** Lab mode's
outward/contextualize layer (**L4c**) is not a lighter pass — it *runs the
topic-mode front-end (Phases 2–6) once per theme*, with the identical
verify/count/dedup guardrails. Topic mode is the next section; lab mode is under
"Lab mode" below.

---

## Output artifacts (per topic batch)

1. New rows appended to `<spreadsheet>.xlsx` with columns:
   `Topic | Ref# | APA reference | Link | Summary | Tag | Family | Cite (OpenAlex) |
   Cite (S2) | PDF (local) | Xref`.
   `Link` is always the DOI URL (`https://doi.org/<doi>`). `Family` (Phase 6b)
   and the two `Cite` columns (Phase 5b) are auto-added by `spreadsheet.py`
   whenever rows carry them.
2. `citation_counts.json` — per-paper OpenAlex + Semantic Scholar counts (Phase 5b)
3. `families.json` + `families.md`, and `<topic>_families.{html,svg,png,pdf}` —
   the theoretical grouping and its interactive figure (Phase 6b, optional)
4. Cross-reference index at `xref_<topic_slug>.json` (after Phase 6)
5. **Only if Phase 7 was opted into:** a narrative review article `<Topic>_review.docx`
   (prose authored into `content.json`, rendered with `tools/review_paper.py`; APA-7 reference
   list pulled from `rows.json`).
6. **Only if Phase 4 was opted into:**
   - PDFs at `papers/<topic_slug>/<paper_slug>.pdf`
   - Browser-helper page `papers/<topic_slug>/_download_helper.html` for
     paywalled / bot-blocked papers

---

## Topic mode — the 8-phase workflow

(The query-driven front-end. Lab mode reuses Phases 3–7 verbatim; see "Lab mode"
below.)

### Phase 1 — Scope the topic

**1a. Read source if provided.** If the user has a source doc (`.docx`/`.pdf`),
extract text. For docx: `unzip -p X.docx word/document.xml | python3 strip_xml.py`.
Identify which references are actually cited in the **main text** (not just in
the bibliography). The bibliography may have hundreds of refs the doc never
discusses; only main-text-cited ones are baseline.

**1b. Define the topic precisely.** Write 3-5 sentences of what counts as
relevant. Include the contested theoretical positions, the methods / sub-areas /
populations involved, and the boundary with adjacent topics. The
search agent will use this verbatim.

**1c. List "already-known" papers.** Pull from the existing spreadsheet
(filter by `Topic`). The search agent must not re-find these.

### Phase 2 — Spawn the literature search agent

Use the `general-purpose` Agent (or any web-enabled subagent). Give it a
self-contained prompt — it has no context from this conversation. Use the
template in `tools/search_prompt_template.md` and fill in:
- `{TOPIC_NAME}` and `{TOPIC_DEFINITION}`
- `{ALREADY_HAVE}` — bullet list of existing papers (don't rediscover)
- `{TODAY}` — current date (gives the agent a recency anchor)
- `{TIER_BOUNDARY_YEAR}`
- `{TARGET_COUNT}` — usually 25-40 papers

The agent should return a numbered list with: APA citation, **DOI link in
`https://doi.org/<doi>` form** (not PubMed/PMC URLs), PMCID if available,
3-5 sentence summary, tag (`classic`/`recent-review`/`recent-empirical`/
`recent-method`/`recent-LLM`/`recent-theory`/`recent-clinical`), and year.

**Do not act on the agent's output yet.** It will contain errors. Proceed
to Phase 2b, then Phase 3.

### Phase 2b — Antecedents (the foundations pass) — REQUIRED

The Phase-2 search is biased toward recent work and the topic's *current*
framing, so it systematically misses the literature the topic was built on. A
review that omits its antecedents reads as if the field began ~10 years ago. Run a
dedicated antecedents pass in both modes (contract rule 4), after the main search
and before verifying.

Spawn a separate search agent **per axis** for the topic's intellectual roots:

1. **Measurement / methodology origins** — the instrument, signal, or technique
   the work depends on, and the papers that established and validated it (e.g.
   for human-fMRI work: the BOLD mechanism, the first functional studies, what
   the signal actually measures).
2. **Foundational empirical results** — the classic findings the topic builds on,
   including older work in adjacent methods, species, or eras that the forward
   search's recency bias skips (e.g. single-unit neurophysiology, psychophysics,
   the first description of an effect or region).
3. **Theory / computational framework** — the conceptual claims that motivate the
   work (e.g. efficient coding, a normative principle, a levels-of-analysis
   framing).

Reuse `tools/search_prompt_template.md`, but **flip the tier emphasis**: the
target here is foundational / highly-cited / classic work that PRE-DATES the
modern literature, not recent papers. Give each agent the already-have list
(now including the Phase-2 results) so it does not re-find them, and have it tag
each paper with the best-fit **existing** theme/family. Antecedents fold into the
existing lanes by default — do NOT spin up new lanes for them unless the user
asks. Feed every returned paper through Phase 3 → 3f → 5b like any other.

**Old classics often have no DOI** (pre-2000 papers, books, book chapters). Keep
them as hand-written canonical APA `no-source` rows (references.py flags them;
the audit gate allows them) and exclude them from `citations.json` — the same
pattern as any DOI-less item. Beware reissue DOIs for old books (they re-date the
work to the reprint year); prefer a hand APA citing the original edition. Verify
each by title/author against the publisher or a library record before trusting
the agent's APA.

**Lab mode:** the antecedents include the lab's OWN pre-paradigm work — the
earlier-method, other-species, or pre-tool publications that the inclusion filter
(Phase L2) drops. Reconsider that filter: a lab's foundational pre-paradigm papers
are usually the most direct antecedent of its current program, and belong in the
corpus as `source=lab` (starred) rather than excluded.

**Effect on the figure:** antecedents widen the time span (often back to the
mid-20th century) while most papers cluster in the last decade. Set the figure's
`--min-year` to the earliest antecedent and add `--time-warp` so the sparse early
decades compress and the dense recent years expand — otherwise the modern
literature collapses into an unreadable clump at the right. See Phase 6b.

### Phase 3 — Verify EVERY citation (CRITICAL)

In a previous run, the search agent fabricated 5 author lists, reversed
one paper's conclusion, and invented a bioRxiv DOI that didn't exist.
About 1 in 4 citations had errors. **Always verify before adding.**

`verify.py` returns one verdict per citation: **OK**, **MISMATCH** (author/year),
**NOT-FOUND**, or **ERROR**. NOT-FOUND and ERROR are NOT the same and must be
handled differently: NOT-FOUND means every lookup completed and none matched
(chase it down — likely fabricated); ERROR means a lookup could not complete
(rate-limit / network), so **re-run those** rather than treating them as missing.
On a big run this matters — arXiv rate-limits hard, so the tool prefetches all
arXiv ids in batches (many per `id_list` call); a genuinely real preprint that
would otherwise 429 into a false NOT-FOUND now comes back OK (or, if the batch
still fails, ERROR to re-run).

For each paper the agent returned:

**3a. If a PMCID was given:** call NCBI esummary
(`https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=pmc&id=<num>&retmode=json`).
Confirm first author, year, and title match. See `tools/verify.py`.

**3b. If no PMCID but a title is given:** call PubMed esearch
(`https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=<title>&retmode=json`)
then esummary. Confirm match.

**3c. If only an arxiv ID:** WebFetch `https://arxiv.org/abs/<id>` and read
title/authors from the page.

**3d. If a publisher landing page (Nature, Springer, OUP):** WebFetch the
page and confirm author/year. Don't rely on the agent's claim.

**3e. Drop / fix:**
- Citation completely fabricated (URL doesn't resolve, no PubMed match) → drop.
- Wrong first author / wrong year → fix using the verified metadata.
- Title matches but agent's summary contradicts the abstract → fix summary.
- Suspicious DOI (e.g. unusual prefix, no resolution) → drop unless you can
  confirm via web search.

Common fabrication patterns to flag:
- Author name that doesn't appear in any of the paper's actual authors.
- Conclusion that is the OPPOSITE of the paper's actual finding.
- A DOI that does not resolve, or that resolves to an unrelated paper (agents
  invent plausible DOIs and also mis-copy real ones — confirm the *target*, not
  just that it resolves).
- arxiv preprint IDs that don't resolve.

**Don't treat an unfamiliar DOI shape as fabrication evidence — resolve it.**
Prefixes and suffix formats drift, so a DOI not matching the shape you expect is
often just a newer pattern, not a fake. Seen in real builds: bioRxiv now issues
`10.64898/...` DOIs alongside the older `10.1101/...`; Imaging Neuroscience uses
`10.1162/imag.a.NNNN` (dots, not the `imag_a_NNNNN` underscores you might guess —
the wrong shape 404s). Always judge a DOI by what it resolves to, never by its
string.

### Phase 3f — Canonicalize EVERY reference (`tools/references.py`)

Verification (3a–3e) confirms a citation is *real*; this makes its `apa` string
*perfect* (contract rule 2). Never ship a reference typed from an agent's memory
(topic mode) or OpenAlex's light metadata (lab mode) — rebuild every `apa` from the
verified DOI against the authoritative source. `references.py` is the single
canonical formatter and a hard gate, used identically in both modes:

```
python3 tools/references.py --rows rows.json --out rows.json   # rebuild + report
python3 tools/references.py --rows rows.json --audit           # gate: exit 1 on any defect
```

It pulls CrossRef (DOIs) or the arXiv API (arXiv ids / `10.48550/arXiv.*` DOIs),
then builds APA-7 with: full author list (>20 → 19 + ellipsis + last), correct
initials and nobiliary particles (`de Heer`, `Dupré la Tour`), fixed name casing
(`ANDERSON`→`Anderson`, `zhang`→`Zhang`), HTML-unescaped + sentence-cased
all-caps titles, and a real venue — including preprint servers CrossRef leaves
bare (`bioRxiv`, `PsyArXiv`, `arXiv`). The `--audit` gate fails the build on any
defect (missing author/year, `et al.`, HTML entity, `U+FFFD` replacement-char
mojibake, truncated/empty venue, uppercase title). The ONLY allowed non-fatal
case is a DOI-less item (book, report, old proceedings) — it keeps its
hand-written `apa` and is reported as a
manual ref; verify those by hand. **Run the gate before every deliverable.**

### Phase 4 (OPTIONAL) — Download PDFs

**Skip this phase by default.** Run only if the user explicitly asks for
PDFs. The default workflow is Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 6 → 7. PDF acquisition
will eventually be replaced by a separate dedicated tool; treat the
machinery below as legacy that still works on demand.

If opted in, try sources in this order (`tools/download.py` does this
automatically):

1. **arxiv direct** — `https://arxiv.org/pdf/<id>.pdf`. Always works for
   arxiv preprints. Only one risk: rate-limit (429) if you hit too fast;
   use 2s sleeps between calls.

2. **Unpaywall API** — `https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/<doi>?email=<user_email>`.
   Returns `oa_locations` with PDF URLs. **Prefer non-PMC URLs first**, since
   PMC has aggressive bot blocking. Often gives author institutional repos
   (`.edu` / `.ac.uk` pages) that work with simple curl.

3. **Direct journal URL via Unpaywall's `best_oa_location.url_for_pdf`** —
   `https://www.nature.com/articles/<id>.pdf` typically works for OA Nature,
   Nat Commun, Nat Neuro, Nat Hum Behav, Sci Rep.

4. **Europe PMC** — `https://europepmc.org/articles/<PMCID>?pdf=render`
   works for many NIH-funded papers.

5. **Manual fallback via browser-helper page (preferred over `_needs_manual.txt`).**
   For papers that fail the auto-download, generate
   `papers/<topic>/_download_helper.html`: one row per failed paper with
   author/year/slug/title and an Open link to the journal landing page (use
   plain `https://doi.org/<doi>` for paywalled — the user has institutional
   access; do **not** wrap in libproxy URLs, those land on a generic library
   page). Use direct PMC `/articles/<PMCID>/` URLs for OA-on-PMC papers and
   `https://www.biorxiv.org/content/<doi>v1` for bioRxiv preprints.
   Open the helper with `open <path>` so it loads in the user's browser. The
   user clicks through, downloads each via the publisher's own PDF button,
   PDFs land in `~/Downloads` with publisher-chosen filenames. Then run
   `tools/reconcile_downloads.py --manifest <topic>/_manifest.json
   --out-dir papers/<topic>/` to read each PDF's first-page title via
   pdftotext, fuzzy-match to the manifest, and move into place with the
   right slug name.

**Verify each download is actually a PDF** (first 4 bytes == `%PDF`).
A 200 response can still return an HTML challenge page.

**Do NOT attempt** these sources — they all reliably fail to bots:
- PMC direct PDF URLs (`https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/<PMCID>/pdf/`):
  Cloudflare Proof-of-Work challenge.
- bioRxiv / medRxiv direct: Cloudflare bot mitigation (403).
- PNAS direct PDF (`pnas.org/doi/pdf/...`): 403 via curl.
- OUP `academic.oup.com/.../article-pdf/...`: 403.
- MIT Press `direct.mit.edu/imag/article-pdf/...`: 403.
- Elsevier ScienceDirect `.../pdfft`: 403.
- Wiley `onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/...`: 403.

These all work fine in a real browser, so route them to the helper page
described in step 5 — don't keep retrying programmatically.

### Phase 5 — Update the spreadsheet

Use `xlsxwriter` (no install if already present; if not, write CSV instead
and tell the user). Schema:

| Topic | Ref # | APA reference | Link | Summary | Tag | Cite (OpenAlex) | Cite (S2) | PDF (local) | Xref |
|-------|-------|---------------|------|---------|-----|-----------------|-----------|-------------|------|

(The two `Cite` columns appear only when Phase 5b has populated them.)

- `Topic`: one of the project's topic categories (e.g. "Multimodal networks").
- `Ref #`: numeric for source-document refs; use `<topic-letter><n>` for
  added refs (e.g. `M1`-`M40` for first multimodal batch, `M41`-`M70` for xref
  batch). Keep numbering monotonically increasing across batches.
- `APA reference`: full APA, list authors up to 6 then `et al.`.
- `Link`: DOI URL in `https://doi.org/<doi>` form — verified to resolve.
  PubMed/PMC URLs are NOT used as the primary link. If a paper has only a
  PMID/PMCID, look up its DOI before adding the row.
- `Summary`: 3-5 sentences. State what the paper did and why it matters for
  the topic. Don't just paraphrase the abstract.
- `Tag`: see Phase 2 list.
- `PDF (local)`: relative path if downloaded, else empty.
- `Xref`: citation count from cross-reference analysis (Phase 6), else empty.

**Color-code rows** so origin is visible:
- White: refs from the source paper.
- Cream `#FFF7E0`: refs added in initial search (Phase 2).
- Green `#E2F0D9`: refs added via cross-citation analysis (Phase 6).

Freeze the header row. Set column widths (~22, 8, 60, 50, 90, 14, 50, 8) and
row heights (~110pt) for readability with wrapped text.

`tools/spreadsheet.py` does the rebuild from a JSON of rows.

### Phase 5b — Citation counts (standard; do this on every review)

Add per-paper citation counts. **Google Scholar is not usable** — it has no
API and CAPTCHA-blocks automated queries after a handful of requests, so it
cannot be pulled for a whole bibliography. Use `tools/citations.py`, which
queries two databases by DOI:

- **OpenAlex** — primary source. Free, no key, reliable, near-complete by DOI,
  batchable. (Undercounts arXiv-only preprints, which it often files under a
  separate record from the published version — cross-check those with S2.)
- **Semantic Scholar** — secondary. Often higher for CS/AI venues and gives an
  `influentialCitationCount`. Its free endpoints rate-limit hard (HTTP 429/400)
  from shared IPs and silently drop papers; treat as best-effort. Set
  `S2_API_KEY` in the environment to make it reliable.

```bash
python3 tools/citations.py --rows rows.json --out citation_counts.json \
        --email you@inst.edu --asof <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

Then attach the counts to each row (`cite_openalex` / `cite_s2` keys) in your
`build_data.py`/rows pipeline and rebuild — `spreadsheet.py` auto-adds the two
`Cite` columns when it sees them. Counts are a snapshot at run time; re-run to
refresh. Papers with no DOI (books, blog/tech-report releases) stay blank.

**Per-version data scripts:** if you split batch data across importing Python
files, guard the xlsx-writing block under `if __name__ == "__main__":` so an
import doesn't rewrite the spreadsheet as a side effect — or just keep all rows in
one JSON and rebuild via `tools/spreadsheet.py` (the simpler path; see Lessons →
On the spreadsheet).

### Phase 6 — Cross-citation analysis (second pass)

Run after Phase 5 is committed. The point: find high-impact papers the
initial search missed by looking at what the papers we DO have cite repeatedly.

**6a. Fetch reference lists.** For each paper with a DOI, call CrossRef:
`https://api.crossref.org/works/<doi>`. The `message.reference[]` field has
the cited refs. Most have a `DOI` field; some have only unstructured strings.
For papers without DOIs (arxiv-only), fall back to extracting DOIs from the
PDF text via `pdftotext -layout <pdf> - | grep -oE '10\.\d+/...'`. This is
crude but recovers some.

**6b. Build the frequency table.** For each cited DOI, count how many of
your N papers cite it. `tools/xref.py` does this.

**6c. Resolve unknowns.** Many cited refs have only a DOI in the CrossRef
response, no title/author. Look these up via CrossRef metadata
(`api.crossref.org/works/<doi>` again, but for the cited DOI).

**6d. Filter and select.** Take refs cited by `≥4` of your papers
(definite-include) plus selected `≥3`-cited foundational classics. Filter
out:
- Refs already in the spreadsheet (check by DOI normalized to lowercase).
- Methods/software citations (SciPy, NumPy, FreeSurfer, fMRIPrep, etc.)
  unless the topic is methods.
- Off-topic refs that just happened to be popular (e.g. a stats paper).

Aim for ~25-35 additions. More than that and the spreadsheet becomes
unwieldy; less and you've under-mined.

**6e. Repeat Phases 3-5** for the new batch. Verify every citation, attempt
PDF download, append to spreadsheet (with the green color and Xref column
populated).

### Phase 6b — Thematic families (OPTIONAL)

Group the finished bibliography into a few **theoretical families** — a
conceptual axis *orthogonal to the Topic column* (Topic captures method/sub-area;
families capture what each paper is fundamentally *for*). Adds a `Family` column
and a `families.md` (grouped tables + a family×topic cross-tab). Run after the
bibliography is assembled, verified, and counted.

This phase has **two judgment gates with a human checkpoint between them**; the
rest is mechanical, owned by `tools/families.py`:

1. **Propose** (agent, reading the corpus via `tools/families.py --digest`):
   propose ~3-8 families, each `{key, name, claim, lineage}`, and state the one
   organizing principle. The hard constraint: families must cut *across* the
   Topic lanes — a good family unites textually-dissimilar papers and splits
   similar ones. **Do NOT cluster embeddings** to make families; that yields
   surface-similarity groups, not theoretical ones. Use the prompt in
   `tools/family_prompt_template.md`.
2. **Confirm** — show the user *just the ~6 family definitions* for approval/edit.
   This is the cheap, high-leverage checkpoint: iterating on six definitions is
   free; redoing the assignment is not.
3. **Assign** — against the frozen spec, assign every paper to one family
   (dominant commitment). Assign in batches for large corpora; never one rushed
   250-paper pass. Write `families_input.json`
   (`{principle, families, assignments:{ref:key}}`).
4. **Validate + render:**
   ```bash
   python3 tools/families.py --rows rows.json --assign families_input.json \
           --out families.json
   ```
   It enforces exhaustive / exclusive / balanced (fails loud otherwise), stamps
   `family` onto rows.json, writes `families.json` (the reproducible cache, like
   `citation_counts.json`) + `families.md`, and `spreadsheet.py` auto-adds the
   `Family` column on the next rebuild. Re-run only when the taxonomy changes.

**The figure is an interactive HTML** (not a static png), produced by
`tools/families_figure.py` from `rows.json` + `families.json`:

```bash
# first emit the within-review citation graph (criterion 2 below); reuses the xref pass:
python3 tools/xref.py --papers xref_papers.json --out xref_<topic>.json \
        --exclude xref_exclude.json --internal-out internal_citations.json --email you@inst.edu
python3 tools/families_figure.py --rows rows.json --families families.json \
        --internal internal_citations.json \
        --out-prefix <topic>_families --title "<Topic> — theoretical families"
```

It writes a self-contained `.html` (family lanes with their defining sentences,
every paper as a dot beeswarm-packed by year, landmark studies as big labelled dots;
hover any node for its full reference, click for citation + DOI, hover a family name
to spotlight its lineage) plus a standalone `.svg` and — if `rsvg-convert`/`inkscape`
is present — `.png` + `.pdf` for slides/papers. This replaces the old static figure.

**Landmark labelling is AUTOMATIC — do not hand-build a labels overlay.** A paper is
labelled as a landmark (big dot) if ANY of: (1) it is among the **most-cited in its
family** (top `--per-family`, default 4, by max(OpenAlex, S2)); (2) it is **foundational
within this review** — cited by ≥ `--motif-min` (default 3) of the corpus's own papers
(this is criterion (2) and needs `internal_citations.json` from `xref.py --internal-out`;
silently skipped if absent — so always pass `--internal`); or (3) it is a **home-lab
paper** — an author surname listed in `--lab-author` or the `LITREVIEW_LAB_AUTHOR` env
var, or a row with `source=="lab"` — these are **starred (★) and gold-ringed** so the
lab's own work stands out. Total labels are capped at `--max-labels` (lab + internal-motif
papers always kept).

> **Home-lab favouring is OFF by default** — this is a shared, lab-neutral toolkit, so
> criterion (3) does nothing until you opt in. Turn it on per project by passing
> `--lab-author Surname` (repeatable), or set it once for your environment with
> `export LITREVIEW_LAB_AUTHOR=Surname` (comma-separated for several surnames). The CLI
> flag overrides the env var. Rows tagged `source=="lab"` (from Lab mode) are always
> starred regardless of the switch.

**Time axis.** `--min-year` clamps the axis start (older papers pin to the left edge).
When the corpus spans many decades but is recency-heavy — the usual shape after a
**Phase-2b antecedents pass** — add `--time-warp <0–1>`. It blends the linear axis with
the empirical CDF of all paper years, GLOBALLY (not per-region): sparse early spans
compress, dense recent spans expand. `0` = linear, `1` = full density-equalizing; **~0.85**
keeps old foundations legible while decluttering the modern clump. Faint gridlines mark the
labelled years so the nonlinear scale stays readable. Always note the nonlinear axis in the
figure caption (independence principle).

**Only the editorial *arrows/notes* remain a human checkpoint** (cross-family convergence
arrows and annotations are judgment). Curate those via an optional `--spec figure_spec.json`
(`{arrows:[{from,to,color,label}], notes:[{at,text,color}], order, subtitle}`); a `labels`
map there still overrides auto-selection if you ever need to force a specific set. Don't
expect a good arrow set auto-generated.

### Phase 7 — Write the review article (OPTIONAL)

Turn the finished corpus into a narrative **review article** as a `.docx`. Run only when
the user asks for a written review (not for the bibliography itself). Prerequisites: Phase 3f
(canonical `apa`) and 5b (counts) are done; ideally Phase 6b families + figure exist too, since
the families are the natural section structure.

**Authorship and honesty (non-negotiable when an LLM writes it).** If the article is
AI-authored, say so plainly. Put the model's name in `authors`, add an `author_note` that
identifies it as an AI, and include a `disclosure` paragraph stating that the bibliography was
machine-assembled and machine-verified and that the author has read only abstracts/metadata, not
full texts. Language models fabricate citations; the Phase-3/3f verification is what makes an
AI-written review trustworthy, and the disclosure must make that provenance explicit.

**Prose.** Author the prose with the `scientific-writing` skill (one idea per sentence, forward
flow, reserve "represent" for brain representations). Organize sections by the **Phase-6b
families** — the theoretical axis orthogonal to the topic lanes makes a better narrative than the
method/region lanes. The title should convey the question, the answer, and why it matters. Every
in-text citation is **APA author–date** (`(Huth et al., 2016)`) and MUST name a paper that exists
in `rows.json`, so the reference list backs it.

**Respect the temporal order of ideas — distil the intellectual history, do not force refs into
the narrative (contract rule 5; confirmed by user 2026-06-13).** The single most common failure of an
AI-written review is crediting the wrong paper for an idea: it picks whichever citation fits the
sentence it wants to write, rather than the paper that actually established the idea first. When a
sentence makes an **origin claim** — signalled by *emerges, first, established, identified,
introduced, was mapped, showed that, had been, early work, foundational, began, demonstrated,
discovery* — it MUST cite the **earliest** paper that deserves priority, and order multiple
citations oldest-first. Four recurring inversions to watch for (each example is a real miss caught
2026-06-13):
- crediting a later **review** for a finding an earlier **primary paper** made (e.g. Tanaka 1996
  review vs. Desimone et al. 1984 for object/face selectivity in IT);
- crediting a later **model/normalisation/synthesis** for a phenomenon earlier **empirical** work
  established (e.g. Reynolds & Heeger 2009 model vs. McAdams & Maunsell 1999 for attention changing
  gain/tuning);
- crediting a later, narrower paper while ignoring an earlier, **more general** one from the same
  year (e.g. Dumoulin & Wandell 2008 pRF vs. Kay et al. 2008's more general per-voxel model);
- in **lab mode**, relegating the lab's OWN foundational paper to a later section while a follow-up
  from another group gets the priority slot (e.g. Hegdé & Van Essen 2000 vs. Gallant et al. 1993
  for complex-form selectivity in V4). The lab's antecedents (Phase 2b / L4c) exist precisely so
  the review can assign priority correctly — use them.

**Priority audit (before delivering the review; contract rule 5).** After drafting `content.json`, run a
dedicated audit pass — analogous to the Phase-3 citation verify and the Phase-2b antecedents pass.
Dispatch one agent with the draft prose plus `rows.json` (which carries every candidate paper and
its `year`) and instruct it to: scan every origin-claim sentence; for each, check whether an
**earlier** paper in `rows.json` (or an undisputed classic) deserves priority for that specific
idea; and report each inversion as `claim → currently cites (year) → earlier source (year) → fix`.
Apply the confirmed fixes (reorder citations oldest-first, add the originating paper, demote the
later review/model to "later", and adjust wording so the sentence reads as history not narrative).
This pass catches what self-review misses because the drafting model is biased toward its own story.

**Mechanics — `tools/review_paper.py`.** The tool owns only the mechanical render; it does not
write prose. It reads `rows.json` and builds the **APA-7 reference list straight from the
canonical `apa` strings** (deduped, alphabetised, hanging indent, with DOI links), embeds the
families figure with a standalone caption, and lays out the title/author/disclosure block + the
abstract + sections. Keep the prose in a small per-project emitter that dumps `content.json`
(see the schema in `review_paper.py`); render with the shared tool:

```bash
python3 write_review.py            # project file: authors prose -> content.json
python3 tools/review_paper.py --rows rows.json --content content.json \
        --figure <topic>_families.png --out <Topic>_review.docx
```

The reference list comes from `rows.json`, so it is automatically canonical and complete; verify
by opening the `.docx` and confirming the figure renders and the section/citation structure reads
correctly. Worked example: `distributed_conceptual_network/` (`write_review.py` + `content.json`
→ an AI-authored review with all 370 refs in APA-7). Output artifact:
`<Topic>_review.docx` (plus the project's `content.json`).

### Phase 8 — Hand off

Tell the user:
- Total rows in spreadsheet, broken down (source / search / xref).
- Any verification corrections you made (e.g. fabricated PMCIDs, wrong
  first authors).
- **Only if Phase 4 was run:** PDFs downloaded vs. failed, and the path to
  the browser-helper page or `_needs_manual.txt` for paywalled papers.

## Lab mode — review a lab's corpus in the context of the field

The workflow above is **topic mode**: it starts from a query and searches
outward. **Lab mode** inverts the front end — it starts from a known body of
work (a lab's publications), derives the lab's research themes and how they
shifted over time, then searches outward to place that work in the field.
Everything downstream (verify, count, families, figure) is the same machinery.

**Phase L1 — ingest the corpus.** `tools/lab_corpus.py` pulls the lab's full
publication list from OpenAlex by author id (use `--search` to find it; pass
several `--author` ids for PI + key lab members, **or for one person whose record
is split across ids**). Output `lab_papers.json`. `--search` prints each
candidate's ORCID and publication year span and warns on the failure shapes that
are visible from the listing alone — read those rather than picking by
institution, which is wrong more often than it is right (see L2).

**Phase L1b — enrich abstracts (REQUIRED).** OpenAlex metadata is not enough:
its abstracts are missing for a sizable minority of papers and its `topics` tags
are coarse, so classifying from them alone mislabels papers. Fill missing
abstracts from Semantic Scholar (`/paper/batch`, by DOI) and/or PubMed first.

**Phase L2 — define the lab & verify the corpus (HUMAN CHECKPOINT #1).** The
load-bearing gate: author-id disambiguation is the #1 correctness risk (OpenAlex
ids split / merge / collide; trainees move between labs). Have an agent classify
every paper **from its actual content — not database topic tags** — into the
buckets the user wants (e.g. for "human work only": `human` / `primate` /
`other`), and **web-verify (PubMed / publisher) every paper without an abstract
and every ambiguous call**. Prune false-positives; keep what the user asked for.
**But do not let the inclusion filter discard the lab's foundational pre-paradigm
work** (the macaque physiology, the pre-tool methods papers): those are the lab's
own antecedents and should re-enter as `source=lab` (starred) in the Phase-2b
pass even when the headline filter is, say, "human fMRI only." Flag them for the
user at this checkpoint rather than silently dropping them.

*Resolving the author id — five real bootstraps, four distinct failure shapes.*
The institution label is the obvious discriminator and it was misleading in three
of the five. Do not pick by it.

| Shape | What it looked like | What decided it |
|---|---|---|
| **Wrong-university** | The id labeled with the right university had 3 works; the correct one showed an unrelated institution and had 130 | Works count, then reading titles |
| **Moved lab** | *Two* candidates carried the university being searched for and neither was the person; one was a glaciologist. The correct id was still labeled with the PI's previous university | **Distinct ORCIDs** settle it instantly; otherwise the raw affiliation strings on the newest works |
| **Merged** | A *single* candidate, spanning 1976–2026, holding at least five different people | The **year span** — `--search` warns above 45 years |
| **Split** | *Three* candidates, all the same person, one holding a single high-profile paper | Same ORCID / same institutions / adjacent years; pass every id to `--author` |

Two rules follow, and they are easy to get backwards:

1. **A single candidate is the DANGEROUS case, not the safe one.** When namesakes
   collide OpenAlex frequently merges them into one id rather than splitting them,
   so "only one match" can mean "all the contamination is in here".
2. **ORCID confirms authorship; it does not refute it.** Use it to establish that
   a surprising paper *is* the PI's — one lab's 18 papers of psychiatric
   neuroimaging looked exactly like a collision and were her own pre-PhD work, and
   pruning on topic would have deleted a third of a real record. But profiles go
   stale: another PI's ORCID listed 18 works against OpenAlex's 39, so **absence
   from ORCID is not evidence a paper belongs to someone else.**

**L2 is therefore a completeness check as well as a purity check.** Every
bootstrap before the split case only ever needed records removed, and nothing
fails when a record is merely missing — so check explicitly for a split id, and
say in writing how many records were added as well as pruned.

*Keeping papers that are genuinely the PI's but not the lab's program.* Early
career work (a PhD in another field, a postdoc in another lab) is real authorship
and L2 has no basis to prune it — but its vocabulary will skew any downstream step
that reads titles. In one corpus such papers were 35% of the total and the keyword
derivation duly proposed *schizophrenia* for a speech lab. Keep them, and record
which groups are off-program in the notes so the next step knows to reject their
vocabulary rather than rediscovering the problem.

**Phase L3 — derive themes (HUMAN CHECKPOINT #2).** Run the families step
(`family_prompt_template.md` → user approves the ~N themes → assign every kept
paper). The "families" are now the lab's research programs; `tools/families.py`
validates/stamps and emits `families.json` + `families.md`.

**Phase L4 — render the lab's trajectory.**
- **Trajectory figure:** `tools/families_figure.py` — themes × year, the lab's
  papers as the spine (milestones labelled, the rest dots). This *is* "the lab's
  topics and how they changed over time."
- **Bibliography:** `tools/spreadsheet.py` (lab papers get the `lab` row color).

**Phase L4c — contextualize: a FULL topic-mode review, once per theme.** This is
NOT an optional or "lighter" pass. Placing the lab in its field means running the
*entire* topic-mode workflow (Phases 2–6) for each theme — same rigor, same
guardrails, no shortcuts. The recurring failure mode is treating this as a quick
"context" add-on and skipping the machinery; that is exactly how a sloppy,
half-fabricated field set sneaks into an otherwise careful review. For each
theme:
1. **Search (Phase 2)** with `search_prompt_template.md` — precise theme
   definition, the lab's papers in that theme as the "already have"/exclude list,
   two-tier criteria (foundational vs recent), a capped target (~30–40), multiple
   query angles. One agent per theme.
2. **Verify EVERY citation (Phase 3)** with `tools/verify.py`.
   It resolves arXiv/conference papers against the arXiv API (batched) — so a
   NOT-FOUND is a real failure to investigate, never "an arXiv paper, skip it."
   Re-run any ERROR verdicts (transient rate-limit/network — distinct from
   NOT-FOUND). Expect ~1 in 4 to need a fix (fabricated author lists, wrong arXiv
   ids, garbage DOIs).
3. **Citation counts (Phase 5b)** with `tools/citations.py` for every field
   paper — bibliographies always carry counts.
4. **Consolidate with two guarded steps (fail loud):**
   (a) **cross-theme dedup** — a paper found by several themes must be assigned to
   exactly ONE (`families.py` checks ref-level exclusivity but NOT duplicate
   DOIs, so dedup by DOI yourself first); (b) **exclude the reviewed lab's own
   DOIs** — the agents only excluded each theme's seed list, so a lab paper from
   theme A can resurface as "field" in theme B. Assert zero field↔lab DOI
   collisions and zero cross-theme duplicate DOIs before merging.
5. **Merge** into the context corpus (lab rows `source=lab`, field rows
   `source=search`) and re-run families + figure (`--emphasize-source lab` to
   keep the lab papers as the labelled spine over the field dots).

The three human checkpoints mirror topic mode: **(1) the corpus** (not a topic),
**(2) the themes**, **(3) the figure**.

The lab's foundational pre-paradigm papers (gathered in L2 + Phase 2b) exist so a Phase-7 review
can assign priority to the lab's own earlier work over later follow-ups from other groups — enforce
that with the priority audit (contract rule 5; Phase 7).

## Lessons learned (don't repeat these mistakes)

### On the search agent
- **Always verify.** ~25% of agent-returned citations have errors. Wrong
  first authors are the most common; the agent confuses similar-titled
  papers and mixes up author lists.
- **The conclusion can be reversed.** Read the abstract before trusting
  any summary — agents have been observed to invert a paper's headline
  finding (e.g., describing "X > Y" when the paper says the opposite).
- **Cap the request.** Asking for 40 papers gives 40-44; asking for "as many
  as possible" gives sprawl with more fabrications.
- **Give exhaustive "do not include" lists.** Without these, the agent
  re-finds papers already in the spreadsheet (3 of 44 in the first run).
- **NOT-FOUND ≠ unverifiable ≠ fine.** arXiv/conference papers used to slip
  through because CrossRef/PubMed can't see them, so they returned NOT-FOUND and
  got waved through. `verify.py` now hits the arXiv API directly; a NOT-FOUND is
  a real problem to chase, never a license to skip. (One run: a "Vo et al."
  attention paper was actually Foster et al.; two Jain & Huth arXiv ids pointed
  at unrelated papers — all caught only because every citation, preprint
  included, was verified.)
- **NOT-FOUND ≠ ERROR — a transient failure must never read as "missing."** On a
  ~90-paper world_models run, 8 real preprints came back NOT-FOUND purely because
  arXiv rate-limited (429) a per-paper loop into a temporary ban; trusting that
  verdict would have dropped real papers. `verify.py` now (a) prefetches arXiv ids
  in **batches** (many per `id_list` call, ~3s apart) so the ban doesn't happen,
  and (b) reports a distinct **ERROR** verdict when a lookup can't complete, kept
  separate from NOT-FOUND. Re-run ERRORs; only NOT-FOUND means "does not exist."
  Pass `expect_year` as a string OR int — either is accepted (a JSON int no longer
  crashes the run), and one malformed row degrades to ERROR instead of aborting.
- **Reference titles are strict APA-7 sentence case; DOIs are the ground truth
  for *location*, the APA string is just the bibliography display.** CrossRef and
  arXiv return titles in inconsistent casing (arXiv and many publishers use Title
  Case; Nature deposits sentence case), so `references.py` normalizes ALL-CAPS
  titles but deliberately does NOT auto-transform Title Case → sentence case:
  correct sentence-casing needs the proper-noun judgment APA bakes in (`Bayesian`,
  `Atari`, `Weber`, `Tolman-Eichenbaum` stay capitalized; `Active`, `World`,
  `Model` lowercase), and a mechanical caser silently mis-cases proper nouns —
  which the audit can't catch. So after canon, **sentence-case new preprint titles
  in a reviewed pass** (auto-protect all-caps acronyms, camelCase/digit model
  names, and hyphen parts; keep a small proper-noun allowlist; eyeball every
  changed title, e.g. a product name like `Matrix-Game`). This is a post-canon
  hand-fix like the mojibake and compound-surname fixes below.

### On contextualizing a lab review (lab mode L4c)
- **The outward search is a FULL topic-mode review, not a "context" add-on.**
  Framing it as optional/lighter is precisely how a sloppy, half-fabricated field
  set sneaks into an otherwise careful review. Run Phases 2–6 per theme with the
  same verify/count/dedup guardrails — no shortcuts.
- **Dedup by DOI and exclude the lab's own papers before merging.** Multiple
  theme-agents find the same landmark (one paper turned up under three themes),
  and an agent only excludes its own theme's seeds — so a lab paper resurfaces as
  "field." `families.py` enforces ref-level exclusivity but not duplicate DOIs;
  assert zero cross-theme dup DOIs and zero field↔lab collisions yourself.

### On writing the review (Phase 7)
- **Order ideas by publication date, not by your narrative.** The drafting model reliably presents
  a later paper as an idea's origin because that ref fits the sentence it wants to write. The rule,
  the four inversion patterns, the real misses caught 2026-06-13, and the required pre-delivery
  **priority audit** are all in Phase 7 — run the audit. Self-review misses these because the
  author is biased toward its own story; an independent pass with the publication years catches them.

### On PDF downloads
Phase 4 has the full source order and the bot-blocked list. Three things that recur:
institutional-repo URLs (`.edu`/`.ac.uk`) from Unpaywall almost always work;
PMC/Cell/Elsevier/Wiley/OUP/MIT Press/PNAS/bioRxiv all block bots (route to the
helper page, don't retry); always validate the first 4 bytes are `%PDF` (a 200 can
be an HTML challenge page).

### On the spreadsheet
- Use a "source" column or color code so a future you (or the user) knows
  where each ref came from and how confident to be.
- **Ref ids must be globally unique, and stay unique across merges.** A
  single-character lane prefix plus a multi-digit counter is ambiguous: lane `4`
  with refs `41…49` then `410…423` parses the same as lane `41`, and a naive
  merge re-emitted the xref batch as `410…` on top of the existing `410…`,
  silently duplicating ids. Two failures followed: `families.py` assigned the same
  paper twice, and — worse — `citation_counts.json` keyed by ref got
  cross-contaminated (two rows sharing id `415` shared one count, so Carvalho 2024
  inherited Elman 1990's 10,838 cites). After any merge, assert
  `len(refs)==len(set(refs))`; attach citation counts only AFTER ids are final (or
  key the counts by DOI, not by ref); and prefer zero-padded or separator'd ids
  (`4-01`, or two-char lanes) so the counter can't collide with the prefix.
- Keep summaries to 3-5 sentences. Long ones become unreadable in a row.
- Don't try to read existing xlsx with xlsxwriter — it's write-only. If
  appending, regenerate the whole file from a JSON of accumulated rows.
- **If you keep batch data inside per-version Python scripts that
  import each other, guard the xlsx-writing block under
  `if __name__ == "__main__":`.** Otherwise importing such a script
  for its data structures (e.g. `from build_bibliography import ROWS`)
  rewrites the spreadsheet as a side effect of import. The simpler
  alternative is to keep all rows in a single JSON and rebuild via
  `tools/spreadsheet.py`.

### On canonicalization & the live table
- **When `--audit` flags `U+FFFD` mojibake, hand-fix it LAST.** CrossRef stores a
  few names/venues with broken encoding (the original glyph is unrecoverable), so
  `references.py` pulls the broken character back in on *every* run. Fix it
  directly in `rows.json` AFTER the final `references.py` pass and before building
  the spreadsheet/figure — fixing it earlier just gets it overwritten on the next
  canon, and you loop on the gate. Real cases: `Bürgel`, `Zeitschrift für
  Anatomie`.
- **CrossRef mis-splits compound / particle surnames** (`Lambon Ralph` →
  `Ralph, M. A. L.`; `de Heer` → `Heer, W. A. D.`). The shared formatter handles
  the common particles, but novel ones slip through and re-canon reintroduces the
  bad split — so correct these in `rows.json` after the last canon, same as
  mojibake.
- **`rows.json` is the live table; the row-emitter script is destructive once you
  pass Phase 3f.** A per-project `build_data.py` (or equivalent) only knows the
  original search rows — re-running it after canon/xref/families drops the xref
  rows and wipes the canonical `apa` + citation counts. After the first build,
  edit `rows.json` directly (or splice via targeted canon); don't regenerate it
  from the emitter.
- **`references.py` prefers the journal DOI over arXiv when a row has both** (the
  version of record), and falls back to arXiv only for preprint-only rows (no
  journal DOI) or rows whose DOI is itself an arXiv DOI. So you no longer need to
  hand-clear an `arxiv` field to stop a published paper from being cited as its
  preprint — just keep both ids and let canon pick the journal version. (Agents
  routinely return a journal DOI *and* the preprint id for the same paper.)
- **BUT: not every "published" DOI is the version of record — check the count
  before you swap.** Curran/Proceedings.com registers DOIs (`10.52202/*`) for the
  *printed* NeurIPS volumes. They resolve, and a CrossRef title search happily
  returns them, but they are shadow records of the paper the community actually
  cites: on a 2026 gallant_lab pass, moving 6 rows to their `10.52202` DOIs would
  have cut OpenAlex counts by ~3-4× (MindEye 40 → 11, Toneva-style rows 34 → 10)
  while adding nothing. ACL Anthology (`10.18653/*`), IEEE/CVF (`10.1109/*`) and
  real journal DOIs are the opposite — genuine upgrades (MindBridge 2 → 41). Rule:
  before promoting a preprint row to a "published" DOI, query the candidate DOI's
  OpenAlex count; if it is much LOWER than the arXiv record's, keep arXiv and note
  the venue in prose. Preprint-heavy CS/AI reviews are where this bites.
- **The same paper can enter a review twice, and per-row canon will never notice.**
  One agent finds the arXiv preprint, another finds the journal version; two
  different DOIs, so the one-row-per-DOI rule passes and *both* rows canonicalize
  perfectly. Three such pairs sat undetected in a 362-row corpus for six weeks.
  `references.py --audit` now runs a corpus-level `duplicate_scan()` and prints
  `⚠ A ~ B: possible duplicate` for near-identical titles (labelling the
  preprint-vs-published case explicitly). It is a **warning, not a defect** — real
  distinct papers do collide (a 2014 toolbox paper and its 2026 successor;
  successive years of the same challenge), so every pair needs a human verdict.
  Keep the version of record, drop the preprint, and re-check any in-text citation
  whose YEAR moves as a result (a preprint→journal promotion can shift 2025 → 2026).

### On cross-citation analysis
- CrossRef coverage varies by publisher. Nature, Cell, OUP, JNeurosci have
  excellent coverage. Some smaller journals deposit no refs.
- ≥4 citations across 40 papers is a strong signal. ≥3 is borderline; only
  pick if the paper is clearly foundational.
- The xref pass typically finds 25-35 papers per topic that the initial
  search missed — almost half as many again.

### On citation counts (Phase 5b)
- **Google Scholar can't be automated.** No API; CAPTCHA after ~10-20 requests.
  Don't try to scrape it for a whole bibliography — use OpenAlex + S2.
- **OpenAlex is the reliable workhorse** (~95%+ coverage by DOI). It undercounts
  arXiv-only preprints (separate record from the published version), so for
  preprint-heavy reviews lean on the S2 number for those rows.
- **OpenAlex's BATCH filter can return a low-count duplicate record** for a DOI
  that has both a merged primary work and a stub (e.g. Whittington 2020 TEM came
  back as 6 from the batch but 667 from the canonical `/works/doi:` endpoint;
  Tolman 1948 as 1 vs 6656). `citations.py` now (a) keeps the MAX count when a DOI
  appears more than once in a batch, and (b) re-queries the single-work endpoint
  whenever the OpenAlex count is < half the S2 count (with S2 ≥ 50). Still
  **spot-check landmark/foundational counts against the S2 column** before
  delivering — a famous old paper showing single-digit OpenAlex is the tell.
- **Semantic Scholar's free endpoints are flaky**: the `/paper/batch` endpoint
  429s and sometimes 400s (one malformed id poisons the whole batch); the
  single `/paper/{id}` endpoint 404s valid papers under load. Set `S2_API_KEY`
  to fix it. Without a key, accept partial S2 coverage — OpenAlex stands alone.
- Counts are a snapshot; record the `--asof` date. Don't expect the two columns
  to match — GS-style totals (which neither gives) run higher than both.

## Reusable helper scripts

All in `<project>/tools/`. Each is standalone, takes input via JSON/CLI,
outputs JSON/files. Run `python3 tools/<script>.py --help` for flags.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tools/verify.py` | Verify a list of citations via PMC/PubMed/CrossRef + arXiv (arXiv ids batched). Verdicts OK / MISMATCH / NOT-FOUND / ERROR — re-run ERROR, chase NOT-FOUND. |
| `tools/references.py` | Phase 3f. Rebuild every `apa` from the verified DOI (CrossRef) or arXiv id into canonical APA-7; `--audit` gates the build (exit 1 on any defect). Both modes. |
| `tools/citations.py` | Phase 5b. Fetch per-paper citation counts from OpenAlex (primary) + Semantic Scholar (secondary) by DOI. Google Scholar is not usable (no API / CAPTCHA). |
| `tools/families.py` | Phase 6b. Validate an (agent-proposed, human-approved) family taxonomy, stamp `family` onto rows, emit `families.json` + `families.md`. `--digest` prints a corpus digest for the proposal step. |
| `tools/families_figure.py` | Phase 6b. Interactive HTML lineage figure from `rows.json` + `families.json` (+ standalone svg/png/pdf). Optional `--spec` for editorial labels/arrows/notes. Replaces the old static figure. |
| `tools/lab_corpus.py` | **Lab mode** Phase L1. Ingest a lab's full publication corpus from OpenAlex by author id (`--search` to resolve). Enrich abstracts before classifying — OpenAlex alone is insufficient. |
| `tools/xref.py` | Build cross-citation index from a list of (slug, doi) tuples via CrossRef. |
| `tools/spreadsheet.py` | Build/rebuild xlsx from a JSON of accumulated rows (DOI URLs as Link). |
| `tools/review_paper.py` | **Phase 7 (optional).** Render a review-article `.docx` from `content.json` (prose) + `rows.json`. Builds the title/author/disclosure block, abstract, sections, embedded figure, and an APA-7 reference list pulled from the canonical `apa`. Prose is authored separately (scientific-writing skill); the tool owns only the mechanics. |
| `tools/search_prompt_template.md` | Prompt template for the literature-search subagent. |
| `tools/download.py` | **Opt-in (Phase 4).** Multi-source PDF downloader. Not run by default. |
| `tools/reconcile_downloads.py` | **Opt-in (Phase 4).** After the user manually downloads PDFs via the browser-helper page, this reads each PDF's first-page title via `pdftotext`, fuzzy-matches it against a manifest of slug+title pairs, and moves the PDF into the per-topic dir with the correct slug filename. |

Each helper is small (<200 lines) and meant to be read + adapted. They are
not a framework — they're scaffolding to keep the LLM judgment work fast.

## Quick start for a fresh Claude

```
1. Read this playbook.
2. Read the existing spreadsheet (xlsxwriter is write-only; convert to CSV
   first via `python3 -c "import openpyxl; ..."` or load via pandas if
   available, or just have the user paste the topic list).
3. Confirm topic + criteria with the user. Do NOT ask whether to download
   PDFs — the default is no (Phase 4 is opt-in only).
4. Phase 1: collect baseline (source-doc citations).
5. Phase 2: spawn search agent using tools/search_prompt_template.md.
6. Phase 3: verify EVERY citation (tools/verify.py).
7. Phase 5: update spreadsheet (tools/spreadsheet.py) with DOI URLs as Link.
8. Phase 5b: citation counts (tools/citations.py); attach to rows, rebuild.
9. Phase 6: cross-citation pass (tools/xref.py); verify and append xref
   batch via Phases 3 + 5 again.
9b. Phase 6b (OPTIONAL): thematic families — propose → confirm with user →
    assign → tools/families.py validates/stamps/renders. Figure is bespoke.
9c. Phase 7 (OPTIONAL): review article — author prose into content.json,
    render with tools/review_paper.py (APA-7 refs from rows.json). If
    AI-authored, state the AI author + a verification disclosure. REQUIRED
    before delivery: run the priority audit (origin claims must cite the
    EARLIEST paper, oldest-first) — see Phase 7.
10. Phase 8: report to user.
11. Phase 4 (PDF download) is OPTIONAL. Only run if the user explicitly
    asks for PDFs.
12. If you changed any tool/phase/command, update the matching docs/ page
    (see "Documentation site — keep it in sync" above).
```

For a topic with ~40 search-added + ~30 xref-added papers, the default
no-PDF workflow takes Claude roughly 1-2M tokens and 5-10 minutes
wall-clock — Phase 6 (xref) is the slowest step (~3-5 minutes for CrossRef
calls). With Phase 4 turned on, add 10-20 more minutes for downloads.
